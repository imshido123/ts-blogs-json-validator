Furthermore, automakers were asked to share ideas on how the government could help to speed their development.</p><p>As legislation is underway, there&#x2019;s high interest in how secure connected car technologies can reduce the 1.3 million fatal road accidents on global roads. NXP invited Senator Peters and other political decision makers to experience NXP solutions from a test drive that included several vehicle-to-x technology demos in action. The demos showed how the car could detect and alert approaching and potentially colliding cars, icy road conditions, and upcoming road construction.

      "content": "<p>It started with a press release. When the Russian company RUTOLL read our announcement of UCODE DNA, the industry&#x2019;s first secure UHF RFID tag, they got in touch. They thought UCODE DNA might be the ideal product for their new toll-collection system for Russian expressways, and they wanted to know more.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/RUTOLL-labels.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-13739 \" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/RUTOLL-labels-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"RUTOLL labels\" width=\"561\" height=\"504\"></a>We confirmed that UCODE DNA is an RFID breakthrough, combining cryptographic authentication with high-speed and long-distance reading, and agreed that UCODE DNA is exceptionally well suited to vehicle registration and automated payments on toll roads.</p><p><strong>Improved traffic flow<br>\n</strong>RUTOLL took the next step, and conducted a study in St. Petersburg. They were pleased with the results: UCODE DNA is so fast, and so accurate, that cars can pass through toll-collection points without slowing down. And, because UCODE DNA uses cryptographic authentication to verify identity, it ensures secure transactions and protects against fraud.</p><p>The company&#x2019;s automatic vehicle identification (AVI) and tolling system is now deployed along several roads including two of Russia&#x2019;s most heavily used expressways &#x2013; the M1 &#x201C;Belarus,&#x201D; which travels east-west and links Moscow to the Belarus capital of Minsk, and the M4 &#x201C;Don,&#x201D; which travels north-south and links Moscow to the many resort towns along the Black Sea. RUTOLL is moving ahead quickly with UCODE DNA &#x2013; the company invests in R&amp;D, explains benefits to partners, actively offers new opportunities to tolling operators and is ready to deploy new solutions at existing and new highways. &#xA0;They recommends deploying the system that supports both active and passive RFID solutions. DSRC transponders could be phased out in the future.</p><p>Changing to an AVI system for toll payment, based on UCODE DNA, helps keep traffic flowing smoothly, since drivers don&#x2019;t need to slow down to pass through a toll-collection point. There are fewer delays, and that means happier travelers. Also, drivers have the confidence of knowing that they&#x2019;ll be charged the right amount, without compromising their personal information, since the system provides the same level of security as a contactless bank card or an electronic ID. Passive RFID technologies provide breakthrough for MLFF (multi-lane free flow) tolling systems. It also allows to deploy a systems faster and at lower costs.</p><p><strong>The best option for secure AVI<br>\n</strong>Before they found UCODE DNA, RUTOLL had considered other approaches, but there were drawbacks with each method:</p><p><strong>Simplicity, performance, and flexibility<br>\n</strong>Aside from security and performance, UCODE DNA is much less expensive than other methods, and presents a simpler distribution scheme, since the small, lightweight tags are easy to deliver and quick to affix to a windshield or license plate. Perhaps even more important, UCODE DNA is a passive technology, which means it doesn&#x2019;t use a battery. It draws power from the reader&#x2019;s antenna, so drivers don&#x2019;t have to worry about replacing or recharging a battery. Also, unlike many batteries, the tags can withstand the very low temperatures of a Russian winter.</p><p>UCODE DNA also gives RUTOLL the option to expand into other areas beyond tolling. The tags can be configured for add-on applications, such as access to paid parking areas or entry into restricted areas. Tags can be updated at any time, so drivers can add a new app whenever needed, and access privileges can be changed quickly if, for example, a driver doesn&#x2019;t renew a subscription, changes jobs, or moves to a new area.</p><p><strong>Join the conversation<br>\n</strong>Have you driven on Russia&#x2019;s M1 or M4 recently? What was your experience with the new RUTOLL system for AVI? How else do you think UCODE DNA might improve the driving experience?

One of the recurring themes in these challenges has been ‘thermal’, and therefore he has spent much of his working life immersed in questions of a thermal nature. He has authored numerous conference papers, magazine articles and application notes on a variety of power semiconductor topics. In his free time he likes nothing better than plodding through muddy fields in the North of England.",

It posed the question: &#x201C;Can I determine the junction temperature (T<sub>j</sub>) of my MOSFET from its case temperature (T<sub>case</sub>)?&#x201D; I demonstrated that, for the <a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/products/mosfets/standard_mosfets/family/LFPAK56_MOSFETS/#overview\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">LFPAK56<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> package, T<sub>j</sub> and T<sub>case</sub> are almost identical whether we consider results from simulation or real-life experiments. At the end of the blog, I left the reader to ponder </em><em>why T<sub>j</sub> </em><em>@</em><em> T<sub>case</sub> &#x2014; that is question that I&#x2019;m returning to now.</em></p><p>To appreciate why T<sub>j</sub> @ T<sub>case</sub>, we need to look at what happens to the majority of the heat energy when it leaves the component. Let&#x2019;s start by considering the somewhat simplified diagram of an LFPAK56 MOSFET mounted on a PCB (Figure 1), and its associated heat paths.</p><p><em>Figure 1. A simplified view of an LFPAK56 MOSFET mounted on a PCB and its associated heat paths to ambient</em></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>The heat paths from the MOSFET die to &#x201C;ambient&#x201D; are quite easy to define, but what is happening to the <em>temperature</em> immediately surrounding the device and PCB? If the die is operating at an elevated temperature, then intuitively we wouldn&#x2019;t expect the air temperature close to the PCB to be at ambient temperature &#x2013; but what is the temperature?</p><p>This question is actually quite hard to answer in the lab as thermal cameras tend to see straight through air. Fortunately we can gain some understanding by running a thermal simulation. See Figure 2. In this case T<sub>amb</sub> = 20&#xB0;C and P<sub>D</sub> = 1W.</p><p><em>Figure 2. Thermal simulation plots of an LFPAK56 device on a PCB</em></p><p>In Figure 2, we see the surface temperature plot of the PCB and also of a vertical &#x201C;slice&#x201D; through the air surrounding the device and PCB. I have left the LFPAK56 device itself uncoloured so that you can see it more easily.</p><p>According to the simulation, T<sub>j</sub> = 69.5&#xB0;C and the temperature of the air flowing upwards from the PCB surface is around 65&#xB0;C at points close to the PCB and device. In other words, the device is surrounded by a blanket of warm air originating from the surface of the PCB which is at a temperature quite close to T<sub>j</sub>. Most of the heating of the case top surface (T<sub>case</sub>) is therefore due to this surrounding blanket of air rather than direct heating of the surface by the die underneath. In fact, the simulation predicts that less the 1% of the total die heat flux is passing out through the top of the device case!</p><p>This result is perhaps another one that we might classify as &#x201C;non-intuitive,&#x201D; but it does go some way to answering our original question of why T<sub>j</sub> @ T<sub>case</sub>. We have to consider more than just the simple one-dimensional internal heat path from the die to the top surface of the package.</p><p>In my next post, I&#x2019;ll take a final look at this scenario, and consider why &#x201C;thermal resistances&#x201D; would not have helped us in this situation.</p>",

How lame would mobile games be without the gyroscope?</p><p>Smartphones (and a lot of other connected devices) are now wired with a wide range of remarkable tools, with more arriving all the time. It only takes a sharp developer and a bit of imagination to turn an overlooked piece of hardware into the next indispensable phone feature.</p><p>Near field communication is a good example. NFC chips have been around for years, installed in smartphones and other consumer devices. Then Apple embraced NFC to develop Apple Pay and now NFC is a common phone feature.</p><p>But there is still work to do. The payment industry tokenization standards used by Apple Pay and other mobile payment services have helped these services scale, and the standards have made it easier for payment services to work with credit and debit cards. But many payment services still do not accommodate customer-specific and merchant-specific use cases like loyalty programs and gift certificates.</p><p><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-13591 alignright\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NFC-Blog-Partner-300x166.jpg\" alt=\"NFC Blog Partner\" width=\"300\" height=\"166\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NFC-Blog-Partner-300x166.jpg 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NFC-Blog-Partner-1024x567.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\">We envision a world where NFC is the only step needed for any transaction&#x2014;not only for payments but for loyalty points and rewards, for proximity offers, digital gift cards, coupons and more. We see all these added-value pieces living together in a single digital wallet, seamlessly using embedded NFC technology, without additional steps. Proximity alone should suffice. We think this is the key to fueling broad adoption of mobile payments.</p><p>To make it happen, NXP and Carta are combining the scalability and broad acceptance of NFC standards with openness and flexibility to enable unlimited opportunities to build merchant-driven value-adds into a single payment tool. It&#x2019;s the best of all worlds.</p><p>Experience the advantages of the Carta platform with NXP&#x2019;s leading NFC capabilities. Carta&#x2019;s technology stack takes the same foundation that now powers large mobile wallet platforms like account issuance and tokenization and extends it with a suite of functionality that enables customizable applications to drive consumer engagement and a more rewarding experience. Through modular tools and powerful API-driven functions, Carta&#x2019;s platform enables developers to create new and exciting products that will introduce the enhanced user experiences that have long been the vision for NFC&#x2014;as well as others we&#x2019;ve never dreamed of!</p><p>Working&#xA0;together, we can bring NFC to a wider market and create custom solutions that make the technology more useful in real life. Customers will be delighted to get 10% off at the register when they tap their phone to pay for their coffee and croissant. They&#x2019;ll be excited to receive a personalized promotion pushed to their phone the moment they walk in the door. They&#x2019;ll collect loyalty points without fishing for a card. They&#x2019;ll tap their phone to use those points when they make a purchase.</p><p>And for vendors and payment providers, it means broad adoption, customer affinity and the chance to stay top of wallet. It means an answer to the all-too-common consumer question: Why should I pay with a tap instead of my old plastic card?&#xA0; Very soon, it will mean users putting those cards in the drawer and wondering how they ever got by without NFC technology.</p><p><a href=\"http://cartaworldwide.com/platform/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Read more about Carta&#x2019;s platform<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p>&#xA0;</p><p>Robot maids? Voice-activated appliances? Automatic meals? The smart home of the Jetsons, America&#x2019;s favorite space-age family, is hovering ever closer to reality. And in 2016 it will arrive on our doorstep.</p><p>Devices like the Roomba, Echo, NFC-labeled recipe for microwaves, Nest, Ecobee Thermostat, Siri and more have made their way into our homes, adding convenience to our lives. What&#x2019;s next?</p><p>Here are five areas where I predict the home will get smarter in the coming year.</p><p><strong>The smart home ecosystem will strengthen</strong><strong>.</strong><br>\nIn the past, the various players in the smart home universe had trouble playing together. The device makers, service providers and platform vendors could never seem to get on the same page. Finally we&#x2019;re seeing clear signs that the big ecosystem players are collaborating to become &#x201C;technology agnostic.&#x201D;</p><p>In 2016, cooperation will accelerate, with more players making technologies compatible via digital handshakes, where we should see more smart connected home devices from living room to kitchen to bedrooms &#x2013; and access to homes. For instance, NXP recently partnered with multiple Gateway solution providers across the globe, such as Connected Object in Europe, Harman Kardon globally and Greenwave Reality in North America, to design the industry&#x2019;s most advanced Smart Multi-Protocol Home Gateway. The gateway is technology agnostic, interoperable to enable multiple consumer services for safety, convenience and energy savings. These kinds of partnerships are vital to convincing consumers that there is value in the smart home.</p><p>Once the big ecosystem players truly &#x201C;interoperate,&#x201D; the feedback loop will shift positive and each new generation of smart home devices will make additional devices even more compelling and convenient.</p><p><strong>Smart devices will evolve from nice-to-haves to must-haves.</strong><br>\nSure, a network-connected Wi-Fi coffee machine that can be remotely activated via a smartphone is a nice to have &#x2013; it means a hot cup of house blend will be waiting for you when you get home. But it&#x2019;s one of the must-have devices and services that will drive the market forward and bring the nice-to-haves along with them.</p><p>Services like home security and energy management are critical because they offer the consumer the most value. For example, knowing your kids are home leaves you less worried, or saving energy helps your pocketbook and the environment.</p><p>What&#x2019;s more helpful if devices can talk, work and sync together to save dollars? The leading edge of the securely connected devices in a home, all working together to help, assist you running the house in most safer, efficient and convenient manner, gives you more time to spend with your family.</p><p><strong>Big data will find its place.</strong><br>\n<img class=\" size-medium wp-image-13538 alignright\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Green-Gateway-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Green Gateway\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Green-Gateway-225x300.jpg 225w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Green-Gateway-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\">This is the year when big data will start pitching in and helping out in the smart home. Until now there have been trials and experiments around big data. In 2016 we should see serious players leveraging big data and analytics to offer meaningful services to consumers. For instance, vendors will track real-time data on your comings and goings to set your thermostat automatically and drive better energy efficiency. A great example of technology that can do this is NXP gateway solutions, which leverages a network of sensors and big data, irrespective of the wireless technologies, to make smart decisions about whether or not to open windows, turn on or off the heating, or activate the security system.</p><p>We&#x2019;re moving into a brave new world where vendors have clear insight to our needs and preferences and can deliver ever-smarter products and services. But they cannot offer real value until the big data piece is in place, which is happening as we speak.</p><p><strong>Convenience will become critical.<br>\n</strong>You can&#x2019;t expect your grandmother to buy a smart lightbulb if it means she has to fiddle with the WiFi router or manually connect the lamp to a home gateway. If the setup process is even remotely technical, the smart home will never happen in a big way. We&#x2019;ve been focused on building solutions to help device manufacturers simplify the smart home for consumers. Making it as easy as tap to install and commission a smart device is required. That&#x2019;s why we integrate our world-class NFC technology in our smart home products and solutions for product makers.</p><p>Tap-and-go NFC technology makes it simple to commission, de-commission, troubleshoot and service any smart device. NFC will emerge as one of the most important technologies of 2016 because it&#x2019;s the easiest way to set up devices in the home.</p><p><strong>Voice control will be heard</strong><strong>.</strong><br>\nWe&#x2019;ve seen the emergence of voice-enabled devices and this trend will continue to pick up speed in 2016. I believe voice enablement, voice activation and context sensing with voice are all essential to the smart home and will greatly speed consumer adoption.</p><p>Voice is very intuitive. Most consumers would rather control a device with their voice than with buttons, switches or apps. That&#x2019;s why voice is now being embedded into an increasing number of smart devices, including the TV remote.</p><p>We&#x2019;ll also see the rise of voice context sensing, which is when a device can sense a particular voice or sound and then take action based on what it has heard. For example, the sound of a window breaking might trigger an action via your smart home security system or a crying baby might trigger a notification to a parent in another room.</p><p>Smart homes are the future. And the future is finally here. Smart home devices and services will become more functional, more convenient and thus more prevalent in the coming year. And we at NXP are bringing life changing and highly innovative technologies to make a smart connected and secure world.</p>",

Here are a few key improvements to consider in your next Bluetooth low energy design for connectivity and energy efficiency for your smart home or wearable device.<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p><p><strong><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/QN9080.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-13524 alignright\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/QN9080-300x235.jpg\" alt=\"QN9080\" width=\"300\" height=\"235\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/QN9080-300x235.jpg 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/QN9080.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"></a>Find the right balance between power and energy consumption<br>\n</strong>It&#x2019;s frustrating to have your smart wearable device drain battery quickly. For the most part, there seems to be an endless battle against weak battery life, finding charging stations or digging deep down in your bags, scrambling for your charger because you need to stay connected. ARGH &#x2013; those moments are familiar and realized by many people.</p><p>And as the industry works toward developing a more connected environment for people and their things &#x2013; the Internet of Things continues to drive demand. Luckily it also drives development, investment and advancement.</p><p>New solutions to improve battery life of wearable devices make their way to consumers. The new QN 9080, a BLE SoC is more like a &#x201C;wearable-on-a-chip,&#x201D; and is designed to provide intelligence for future wearable devices. The solution is jam-packed with features like an ARM Cortex M4 to run various applications like interface and a fusion signal processor for &#x201C;always-on&#x201D; sensing to make your device smarter.&#xA0; However, what the QN 9080 really does is finds a meaningful balance between power and energy consumption, minimalizing impact of usage on battery.&#xA0; With solution like the QN 9080, consumers can expect to use their wearable devices for up to a month without recharging.</p><p><strong>Use a proven technology when building a wireless mesh network<br>\n</strong>When you think about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_mesh_network\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">wireless mesh networks<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> (or at least when I do), the first thing that comes to mind is <a href=\"http://www.zigbee.org/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">ZigBee<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>. Such networks are starting to penetrate the industrial markets, but they certainly haven&#x2019;t taken the industry by storm. There&#x2019;s another entrant on the horizon, and it has some qualities that could provide some sticking power.</p><p>There are some very good reasons to use <a href=\"https://www.bluetooth.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Bluetooth<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> as the backbone to a wireless mesh network. This could include designers&#x2019; familiarity with the technology, users&#x2019; familiarity with the technology, and the lower pricing due to the high volumes of Bluetooth components.</p><p>In an attempt to make the Bluetooth mesh technology more pervasive, the <a href=\"https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Bluetooth Special Interest Group<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> (SIG) recently formed the Bluetooth Smart Mesh Working Group. The charter of the working group is to build the architecture for standardized mesh networks using Bluetooth Smart technology (Bluetooth Smart, aka Bluetooth 4.0, has some intelligence built in to reduce power).</p><p>Applications for Bluetooth mesh networks include those found in most every consumer&#x2019;s home: door locks, lights, HVAC systems, and white goods (washers, dryers, refrigerators, and so on). That&#x2019;s just the tip of the iceberg. For every consumer application, there are likely a dozen industrial applications (where margins could potentially be significantly higher).</p><p>More than 80 Bluetooth SIG member companies have volunteered to serve on the Bluetooth Smart Mesh Working Group. The SIG claims that this is higher than for any other working group, which tells you just how high a priority this initiative is. And the companies span a broad array of industries, including automotive, mobile phones, industrial and home automation, consumer electronics, and computing, to name a few.</p><p>According to the Bluetooth SIG&#x2019;s website, the group&#x2019;s objective is to build a common platform that all members can develop to. Their goal is to have the specification ready for prototype testing later this year, and then officially adopt profiles in 2016. Bear in mind that industry groups are notorious for not hitting their deadlines.</p><p>One of the keys to having a successful mesh (and there are obviously different ways to define success) is to add intelligence to the network. A primary reason for this addition is to reduce the power consumption. For example, the network that&#x2019;s built with <a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers/product_series/qn902x/QN9020.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">NXP&#x2019;s QN9020 controller<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> puts a routing table into each node, thereby making it a &#x201C;smart node.&#x201D; That routing table helps determine the best data path, which raises efficiency, which lowers the power draw. Another feature of the QN9020 is that it can be updated on the fly, which is key since the standard is still in flux. And it&#x2019;s a simple process, as easy as updating an app on your smart phone. The QN9020 integrates a Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) radio, a controller, a protocol stack, and profile software on one chip. Among other features, it also includes a high-performance MCU and on-chip memory.</p>",

The launch was so successful, in fact, and made the card such a vital part of campus life, that Gallagher was honored, in 2008, with the <a href=\"http://www.cbord.com/news/pressrel_221.htm\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Professional Development Award<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> from the National Association of Campus Card Users (NACCU).</p><h3>Expanded capabilities</h3><p>Under Gallagher&#x2019;s direction, Villanova recently expanded the Wildcard system to integrate CBORD&#x2019;s new <a href=\"http://www.cbord.com/enews/article.asp?articleid=991\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">CS Gold Mobile Reader&#x2122;<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, an app that makes it possible to process campus-card transactions anywhere and at any time. &#x201C;Our students want convenience, and we are always looking for ways in which the Wildcard can provide more of it,&#x201D; she says.</p><p>The CS Gold Mobile Reader eliminates the need for dedicated, fixed-in-place. Simply download the iOS or Android app to a tablet or smartphone, attach a low-profile reader, and you&#x2019;re ready to process sales or track activities. The app is designed for compatibility with the widely used MIFARE standard, and can read MIFARE Classic, MIFARE Ultralight, and MIFARE DESFire EV1 cards using the internal NFC capability on compatible smartphones and tablets. Students confirm their identity or initiate a transaction by simply tapping their MIFARE-based Wildcard to the device running the app.</p><p>The new app helps Villanova improve student services, making it easier to verify credentials and student status. The app can, for example, confirm attendance in classes or labs, record work hours for student employees, verify active student status for entry to campus facilities, or check people in and out of off-site events, like field trips. On career days, the system makes it easier to register students in more detail, with notes about their major, year of graduation, and so on. The app even provides a way for students to submit critiques of their professors.</p><p>Campus staff are taking advantage of the app, too. The human resources department uses it to verify employee ID number, public safety uses it to report overtime, and the custodial staff use it for quick notifications, reminding people to pick up their paycheck or attend required safety classes.</p><p>The app&#x2019;s access-control logs help increase security, especially in an emergency. University personnel can identify who&#x2019;s entered or exited a particular location, so as to account for people&#x2019;s whereabouts and stay on top of situations as they evolve.</p><p>More than 40 mobile readers are in regular use by various departments throughout the school, and another dozen readers are available to students. &#x201C;The students love the technology,&#x201D; says Gallagher. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re always coming up with new ways to use the readers.&#x201D;</p><h3>Extended benefits</h3><p>With the new CS Gold Mobile Reader, the school&#x2019;s Wildcards can be used in more places and in more ways, and that adds a new level of flexibility and convenience to the setup. The app also gives Villanova greater return on their initial Wildcard investment, and maintains the school&#x2019;s reputation as a leader in campus innovation.</p><h3>Join the conversation</h3><p>What are some of the more creative applications you&#x2019;ve seen for campus cards?

It&#x2019;s the perfect destination for Stella Lux to demonstrate the future of green mobility.</p><p>The next event was at Tongji University where students demonstrated Stella&#x2019;s V2X enabled traffic light phasing and timing abilities. Using NXP technology to connect Stella Lux to infrastructure and other cars could lead to significant improvements to traffic flow in cities and help ensure solar car drivers are able to optimize the life of their battery charge. Stella is also able to give drivers real-time warnings of upcoming hazards beyond the driver&#x2019;s line of sight and over distances of more than one mile in order to prevent accidents.</p><p><img class src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Pic-2.jpg\" alt width=\"900\"></p><p>As well as the technical obstacles, one of the other major challenges to global roll out of smart solar cars will be to overcome cultural barriers.</p><p>&#x201C;One of the things we found working with students from Chinese universities is that they always ask about our professor or mentor. We had to explain we don&#x2019;t have one. We built this car as a team of students in a very flat team structure with no professor leading us. The Chinese have a much more hierarchical approach to working. During this visit to Shanghai we were able to learn more about the way they work and think about how we can better collaborate together in the future.&#x201D; Tom Selten, team leader for Solar Team Eindhoven, explains.</p><p><iframe title=\"Stella Lux: Solar-powered, energy-positive vehicle\" width=\"1220\" height=\"686\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VfYsv_xdNxU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>The final stop was a <em>Popular Science</em> Expo where the public saw Stella Lux up close.

      "content": "<p>If you ask people to define their digital identity, their answers typically fall into one of three categories:</p><p>The correct answer? &#x201C;Yes, and.&#x201D; Your digital identity is comprised of all these things, along with the multiple breadcrumbs you leave throughout a normal day online, via your mobile phone, and by simply walking through the world as you&#x2019;re tracked by the Internet of Things. As sensors have evolved to become cheaper and ubiquitous in nature, you can also track your inner self via wearables popularized by the Quantified Self movement. Soon our actions will also be universally tracked within virtual environments provided by frameworks like <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Oculus Rift<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> or Microsoft&#x2019;s new <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">HoloLens<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>&#xA0;technology.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of outside actors tracking your actions, emotions, and intentions every day.<br>\nEvery hour.<br>\nEvery moment.</p><p>So here&#x2019;s my question as you think about your future digital self:</p><p><em>Do you want external algorithms to know you better than you know yourself?&#xA0;</em></p><p>It&#x2019;s not a rhetorical question. And it&#x2019;s not a question of preference, meaning, do you want to track your personal data or not. Today, as you read this article, your preference may be not to upload photographs to Facebook, to tweet, or even use a mobile phone. That&#x2019;s your choice. But you&#x2019;re still being tracked.</p><p>However, there&#x2019;s no need to live in fear of surveillance if we shift the context of the data conversation <em>from privacy to control</em>. This allows us to create a Life Management Platform to control how others accessed our personal data where we can benefit from all the insights our digital identity provides. In the same way preference driven algorithms analyze our data today, these platforms will allow individuals to benefit from information tracked about their lives.</p><p>Life Management Platforms are beginning to take off around the world. At the core of all of them is something called a Personal Cloud which functions like a Dropbox for all the data related to your digital identity. Today, most people think of their personal data only as it relates to the online world &#x2013; you choose certain information to be released to your bank, while other data can only be accessed by close friends. A Personal Cloud would allow you to decide how your data can be accessed in any life situation, real or digital, so you don&#x2019;t have to constantly provide passwords or data permissions throughout your day.</p><p>For instance, while walking to the bank to make a deposit, you could decide how your location data is accessed (via GPS), if you want to be contacted by local businesses (via blue-tooth or Beacon technology) or tagged by facial recognition technology. Clouds and Life Management Platforms will allow us to define how we want our data accessed by all of the stakeholders currently doing so without our knowledge or content.</p><p><em>Read more&#xA0;on how we can profit from Life Management Platforms <a title=\"Controlling Your Digital Identity Will Determine Your Wellbeing\" href=\"http://mobileworldcongress.nxp.com/2015/controlling-your-digital-identity-will-determine-your-wellbeing/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">here<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>.</em></p>",

      "content": "<p>Car radar, car-to-car and car-to-Infrastructure communication systems serve a wide range of purposes. Among them, increased safety &amp; comfort, smoother traffic flows with less congestion, and reduced fuel consumption. Today, we use our most advanced technologies to build systems that alert drivers to any potential danger. This enables large numbers of cars to move as one, avoiding obstacles and maintaining a safe distance from each other. The various wireless communication technologies we use are all based on RF:&#xA0; electromagnetic radiation at Radio Frequencies.</p><p>Scientists and inventors have traditionally used examples from nature for their own man-made derivatives. In aviation, in medicine, in all kinds of machinery and equipment, nature has been a tremendous source of inspiration. When considering the patterns of massive numbers of cars migrating from A to B, we can see similar phenomena in nature.</p><p>A murmuration of starlings</p><p>Think of those huge flocks of starlings forming a so-called murmuration. Who has never wondered how they seem to move as one, how they fly at high speed in the same pattern without colliding once, all seeming to know where they are heading. They warn each other in a split second in case of an approaching predator, and adjust their direction accordingly, in perfect synchronization. Huge schools of fish, like sardines, show similar behavior. They even cluster to mimic the shape of one big fish in an attempt to scare off predators.</p><p>A school of fish mimicking one big fish to deter predators.</p><p>Biologists are still studying the technologies and senses birds and fish use to show this incredible synchronized behavior. Sight will play a role, as will sound, but is that all? Is it ultrasound? Or light invisible to the human eye? Or some other type of radiation we even don&#x2019;t know yet?&#xA0; And how does the system work: is there one leader who directs all other &#x201C;nodes in the system&#x201D;, does each animal pass on signals to its neighbor, and how? And why on earth does not a single bird or fish miss the message and move in the wrong direction? The animal systems of collision-avoidance and spatial awareness show a level of reliability rarely seen in human-made wireless communication systems.</p><p>NXP is using its leadership in wireless RF communication, in low-power design and in security, to develop superior chips for Car-to-X communications, and for other networked systems with many interconnected nodes, such as the Internet of Things. At the same time we are studying alternative wireless communication technologies, based on other physical phenomena like visual light, ultrasound, magneto-inductive signals, body-coupled communications and others. This helps us explore and innovate in flawless, low-power, and secure next generation wireless communication systems. We will continue to include nature as an endless source of inspiration for innovation, drawing lessons from the flawless designs of the world around us<em>. &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</em></p><p>&#xA0;</p>",

      "content": "<p>Historically, logic product offerings consisted of quad, hex and octal standard logic gates, inverters and buffers. Entire applications were built from these building blocks. As greater integration and miniaturization occurred, the demand for logic solutions continued to grow, but shifted toward &#x201C;glue&#x201D; or &#x201C;control&#x201D; logic.</p><p>With the shift to control logic applications, engineers left much of the standard logic solution unused, often only using one or two of the four logic gates in a quad device. However, this situation posed a problem when circuit boards became increasingly complex and more densely packed, necessitating logic and voltage translation solutions tuned to the exact electrical and physical specifications of the application, and with no margin for inefficient use of components. The larger pin count and package sizes available in standard logic also complicated layout and hindered smaller form fit applications.</p><p>As the leading innovator in package technology, NXP introduced Mini Logic to address these issues. Mini Logic provides solutions in single-, dual- and triple-gate leaded (PicoGate) and leadless (MicroPak) packages, simplifying layout and reducing footprint by 85% or more. Designers can now combine the logic function and package footprint that best suits the application.</p><p>NXP offers the largest, most comprehensive portfolio of 0.8 V to 5.0 V Mini Logic products, and invented the world&#x2019;s smallest 5-pin logic package&#x2014;the 5-pin MicroPak package. In 2013, NXP also released the AXP family of Mini Logic solutions, which offers the lowest power logic solutions, another innovation that enables smaller form factors through reduced battery sizes for equivalent operational duration.</p><p>NXP also works with its partners to integrate more features and functionality into the Mini Logic portfolio. For example, NXP offers configurable logic that allows design flexibility, reduced inventory cost and faster qualification for customer applications. By combining more than one function in a single package and offering the flexibility to configure them separately, engineers always have glue logic readily available to economically solve any design issue, while saving even more space, power and cost.</p><p>Whether an application requires low voltage, low power, or the stringent requirements of automotive qualification, NXP has the ideal Mini Logic solution to help.</p><p><strong>Get the details:</strong></p><p>To learn more, visit the Mini Logic Portfolio page to download datasheets for NXP Mini Logic products.

      "content": "<p>Istanbul, the most populous city in Turkey, is a busy place. Home to roughly 14 million residents, and one of the fastest-growing metropolitan economies in the world, it&#x2019;s a European Capital of Culture, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and a destination for more than 12 million foreign visitors each year. It&#x2019;s also the only places in the world where you can cross from one continent to another by simply driving across a bridge.</p><p>But you might think twice before directing your car to one of the bridges that cross the Bosphorous straight, linking Asia and Europe, because Istanbul is also known for something else &#x2013; traffic jams. It can take hours to get across one of the city&#x2019;s bridges, especially during rush hour, but most drivers will tell you that being in a car in Istanbul at just about any time of day usually means frustratingly long delays.</p><p><strong>Leaving traffic delays behind: Istanbulkart</strong></p><p>Bumper-to-bumper traffic may be one of the reasons why public transport is on the rise. Another reason is the <u><a href=\"http://istanbulkart.iett.gov.tr/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Istanbulkart<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></u>, a transport-payment card introduced in 2009. More than 15 million Istanbulkart cards have been sold to date, and there are more than 10 million Instanbulkarts currently active in the field.</p><p>Similar to the well-known automatic-fare cards used in other cities, such as London&#x2019;s Oyster card and San Francisco&#x2019;s Clipper card, the Istanbulkart offers lots of options for getting around without a car. It works throughout the city&#x2019;s complex public-transport system, which includes everything from public buses, trains, and trams, to subway lines, ferries, and funiculars, and encourages transfers with discounted fares. A single metro ride, for example, is just 0.3&#x20AC; with an Istanbulkart, but costs three times as much if you pay with cash or a token.</p><p><strong>More than a transport card</strong></p><p>The Istanbulkart can also be used to pay for parking, so you can drive part of the way and then transfer to public transport for the rest of your trip, and even pays for public restrooms in the metro system. After a stressful day at work you could also just jump off the bus and get access to the public beach with your Istanbulkart, just tap and relax along the city&#x2019;s extensive shoreline before you finish your trip home.</p><p>Implemented and managed by the Turkish system integrator Belbim, the Istanbulkart system continues to expand. For example, it covers trips to the Prince Islands, which are about 20 km from the city proper, and a popular day trip for residents and tourists.</p><p>University students have their own special Istanbulkart being University ID and public transport card in one to access the University and the whole portfolio of public transport from ferry to subway.</p><p><strong>Proven security</strong></p><p>The Istanbulkart is based on <a href=\"https://www.mifare.net/en/products/chip-card-ics/mifare-desfire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">MIFARE DESFire<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>,&#xA0;the leading industry standard for contactless and dual-interface smartcard schemes. MIFARE DESFire&#xA0;uses a highly secure, microcontroller-based format that&#x2019;s certified with Common Criteria EAL4+ on the hardware and software implementations, so it&#x2019;s a safe choice for all kinds of transactions, especially purchases and payments.</p><p><strong>A better way to go</strong></p><p>Traffic jams may be a fact of life in Istanbul, but the Instabulkart is making it faster, cheaper, and less stressful for many in Istanbul to get around. Commuters can work or relax while they make their way to and from work, knowing that they&#x2019;ll be on time. And, as with anyone who leaves the car at home, they can be happy about the fact that they&#x2019;re helping to ease congestion, reduce pollution, and make the city a little more livable for everyone.</p><p><strong>More to come</strong></p><p>The Istanbulkart is continously adding applications. Since a variety of different applications and partners are available in the MIFARE ecosystem it is easy to ad new applications. Bikesharing will be next in a row of new applications that will be incorporated into istanbulkart. Stay tuned for more to come.</p><p><strong>Join the conversation</strong></p><p>Have you driven in Istanbul? What was it like? And what about the city&#x2019;s public-transport system? Have you used it, or the Istanbulkart?

In a recent <u><a href=\"http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/pressrelease/access-control-authentication-market.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">report<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></u>, issued by technology analysts Transparency Market Research (TMR), healthcare is one of the fastest growing segments for NFC, representing a CAGR of 20.4%.</p><p>The <u><a href=\"http://www.nfc-forum.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">NFC Forum<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></u> has taken note, and considers healthcare a key vertical market sector. They&#x2019;ve even established a Healthcare SIG, to help expand its use.</p><p>So why all the attention? Several reasons. NFC is intuitive to use, widely available, and cost-effective to implement, but, perhaps most important, provides the advanced security needed to protect medical information.</p><p>Here are six ways NFC helps healthcare organizations provide better, safer care:</p><p><strong>1. Secure physical access (to buildings, medications, equipment, etc.)</strong><br>\nMany healthcare facilities, including hospitals, treatment centers, clinics, and even pharmacies, have areas that are open to the public and areas that aren&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s important to keep these areas separate, and only allow authorized personnel to access things like medical cabinets or operating rooms. Employee badges, smartphones, and other devices can be equipped with NFC for access privileges, and NFC tags can track and log every entrance and exit.</p><p><strong>2. Secure logical access (to medical information)</strong><br>\nThe virtual world needs the same kind of protection as the physical world, especially when there&#x2019;s medical information involved. At the same time, healthcare personnel need quick, convenient access to databases and files, so they can provide the best possible care. Using NFC to control access to computers, tablets, and other devices is a convenient, secure way to protect data while making it faster and more efficient to perform routine tasks, such as updating files and checking records.</p><p><strong>3. Real-time updates on patient care</strong><br>\nNFC lets you track where people are, and who&#x2019;s done what. Medical staff can know, in real time, where a patient is, when the nurse last visited, or what treatment a doctor just administered. Data is captured and stored in access-controlled databases, and viewable in different formats, to help streamline logistics, simplify record-keeping, and prevent errors. NFC tags and NFC-enabled wristbands can replace the traditional bracelets worn by patients, and can be updated with real-time information, such as when a medication was last given, or which procedure needs to be performed.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/aa.png\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5096\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/aa.png\" alt=\"aa\" width=\"331\" height=\"241\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/aa.png 720w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/aa-300x219.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px\"></a></p><p><strong>4. Intelligent ID bracelets</strong><br>\nNFC helps in everyday situations, too. People with life-threatening conditions, such as diabetes, asthma, or allergies to food or medications, can replace their metal &#x201C;Medic-Alert&#x201D; bracelets with NFC-enabled wristbands that can provide greater detail to first responders in an emergency. (One such bracelet has already been demonstrated by HealthID Profile &#x2013; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.nfcworld.com/2013/07/30/325197/healthid-introduces-nfc-medical-bands-and-cards/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">here<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></span> are the details.)</p><p><strong>5. Home monitoring</strong><br>\nNFC opens up new possibilities for home monitoring, since an NFC-enabled wristband can be configured to track vital signs. The patient taps the wristband to a smartphone or tablet, and the medical data is transmitted to the doctor&#x2019;s office, where a medical professional can check it. People who have chronic conditions can see a caregiver less often, and people who are recovering from an illness or surgery can return home sooner.</p><p><strong>6. Safer medications</strong><br>\nWhen NFC tags are added to a medication&#x2019;s packaging or labeling, simply tapping the tag with a smartphone or tablet lets you verify the medication&#x2019;s authenticity, view details about dosages, or read about side effects and drug interactions. The tag can also provide access to web links, to get more information, request a refill, or contact a medical professional.</p><p>These are just some of the ways NFC can enhance healthcare. As the industry continues to adopt the technology, we can expect NFC to play a major role in enhancing care by reducing costs, increasing efficiency, and improving outcomes &#x2013; in healthcare facilities and at home.</p><p><strong>Join the conversation</strong></p><p>Do you use an NFC-enabled device for personal wellness or healthcare?

      "content": "<p>At the end of my <a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/tech-in-depth/the-accidental-thermal-engineer-top-clip/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">previous post &#x2013; Top Clip</a> , I mentioned we would be moving on to the subject of top-side cooling next. While we are definitely going there, I&#x2019;d like to cover one other topic first, which will ultimately form part of the overall top-side cooling story.</p><p>A question regularly asked by our customers is &#x201C;Can I determine the junction temperature (T<sub>j</sub>) of my MOSFET from its case temperature (T<sub>case</sub>)?&#x201D;. This is a perfectly reasonable thing to ask because we certainly want to know whether our MOSFETs are running at a safe temperature in-circuit, but at the same time determining T<sub>j</sub> in-circuit can be extremely difficult. On the other hand, T<sub>case</sub> can often be determined quite easily by using a thermocouple or (preferably) a thermal camera. So, can we infer T<sub>j</sub> from T<sub>case</sub>? This question has arisen so often that we recently performed a series of experiments to determine if such a correlation between T<sub>j</sub> and T<sub>case</sub> does indeed exist.</p><p>To carry out this experiment we need a method of applying a constant, known power dissipation (P<sub>D</sub>) to a device whilst simultaneously monitoring its steady-state T<sub>j</sub>. Fortunately such a method exists and is thoroughly documented in <a href=\"http://www.jedec.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">JEDEC<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> standard JESD51-1. This describes how a MOSFET body diode can be used simultaneously as both a heating element and calibrated temperature sensor. JESD51-2 describes a standardized test environment so we can use that too, and off-the-shelf test equipment for carrying out thermal analysis is available from various manufacturers including <a href=\"http://www.analysistech.com/semiconductor.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Analysis Tech<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> and <a href=\"https://www.mentor.com/products/mechanical/micred/t3ster/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Mentor Graphics<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>.</p><p>Most of the queries we received on this subject relate to <a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/products/mosfets/standard_mosfets/family/LFPAK56_MOSFETS/#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">LFPAK56<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> devices, so we&#x2019;ll focus on those in this experiment, and we&#x2019;ll carry out the tests for three different PCB copper areas and a range of power dissipations. Add a thermal camera to measure T<sub>case</sub> on the top of the device and we&#x2019;re ready to go!</p><p>In the graph below you can see the results.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Figure-1.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"wp-image-5078 alignnone\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Figure-1-1024x669.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\" width=\"558\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Figure-1-1024x669.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Figure-1-300x196.jpg 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Figure-1.jpg 1221w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px\"></a></p><p><em>Figure 1 Measured T<sub>j</sub> and T<sub>case</sub> v P<sub>D</sub> for an LFPAK56 device on various PCBs</em></p><p>The graph of Figure 1 demonstrates that T<sub>j</sub> and T<sub>case</sub> are indeed very close in most cases &#xA0;&#x2013; with the worst-case difference being around 4% for the 10&#xD7;10 mm PCB. Of course, as these are real measurements we also have to consider that the measurement methods will have their own accuracy limits, and these are included in the graph as vertical error bars. If I carry out thermal simulations of similar device and PCB setups then the T<sub>j</sub> and T<sub>case</sub> results are even closer, as can be seen in Figure 2. This time, the temperatures are almost identical.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Figure-2.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"wp-image-5079 alignnone\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Figure-2-1024x669.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\" width=\"557\" height=\"363\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Figure-2-1024x669.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Figure-2-300x196.jpg 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Figure-2.jpg 1221w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px\"></a></p><p><em>Figure 2 Simulated Tj and Tcase v PD for an LFPAK56 device on various PCBs</em></p><p>This is a very useful result as it would tend to suggest that, for the LFPAK56 package at least, we can consider T<sub>j</sub> and T<sub>case</sub> to be almost the same with a reasonable degree of accuracy. It&#x2019;s also probably fair to say that this is another example of a non-intuitive result! In my next post I&#x2019;ll return to this subject and consider <em>why</em> T<sub>j</sub> and T<sub>case</sub> are so similar. In the meantime, the interested reader might like to ponder for themselves reasons why T<sub>j</sub> @ T<sub>case</sub> (hint: and it doesn&#x2019;t really have anything to do with thermal resistances).</p>",

As 2015 draws to a close, this question still remains unanswered for most people. Why is this?</p><p>The barriers to entry to build a wearable are relatively low. Microcontrollers and sensors, the building blocks of many wearables, have become cheaper and more widely available than ever before. Crowdfunding websites are full of start-ups with next great wearable products that are often over funded. So why have so many failed to launch? Or why are those that have launched, failed to resonate with customers?</p><p>The wearables market is evolving and experiencing growing pains. Customer value is still unclear and this has prevented many wearables to &#x201C;stick&#x201D; and then be abandoned rapidly. Wearables offer that ability to totally revolutionize the way we interact and use technology. However, the challenges faced in getting a wearable to market are also forcing an industry transformation. Wearables are pushing design and manufacturing into unchartered territory &#x2014; miniaturizing design, placing electronic components on plastics and curved surfaces while using conductive adhesives. This design environment is exemplified by the following quotes:</p><h3><strong>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s called hardware for a reason &#x2013; it&#x2019;s hard.&#x201D;</strong></h3><p>&#x2013; Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Mosaic and Netscape</p><h3><strong>&#x201C;No hardware plan survives contact with a factory.&#x201D; </strong></h3><p>&#x2013; Cyril Ebersweiler, founder of HAX Accelerator</p><p>WaRP, a wearable reference platform, was developed by Freescale and partners to help designers overcome these challenges.&#xA0; WaRP shortens time to market by delivering a wearable form-factor platform based on a hybrid architecture&#xA0; with a multimedia applications processor and a microcontroller, to address the varied usage models for the wearables market. The open source design allows developers to take the platform as a starting point and innovate without licensing restrictions.</p><p>During the development and manufacturing of WaRP, we faced many of the same issues our customers struggle with:</p><p>The future of the wearables market is hard to predict, but constant change and adaption are guaranteed. Evolving with this changing market, Freescale is developing a next generation WaRP 7 which will be based on the i.MX 7Solo applications processor.&#xA0; The WaRP 7 takes the learnings from WaRP and delivers an innovative platform that utilizes the heterogeneous architecture of an ARM Cortex-A7 and a Cortex-M4 core to deliver a high performance, low power architecture specifically designed for wearables.</p><p>To help ensure that WaRP 7 will meet wearable development key challenges, and to help ensure low cost component availability and design for manufacturability, Freescale is partnering with Element14 to design, manufacture and support the platform. Element 14&#x2019;s experience in small form factor design, manufacturing capability and experience in supporting the development community will enable any wearable project to utilize WaRP7 and potentially finally answer the question, what is needed to be successful in the wearables market.</p><p>For more details on what&#x2019;s coming, go to <a href=\"http://www.element14.com/warp7\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">www.element14.com/warp7<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> or visit the Freescale booth #500 at <a href=\"http://www.armtechcon.com/passes-pricing/?_mc=SEM_ADW_LE_ARM15_0111&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQiAyIayBRDo4vjdqJrgxZ0BEiQAhOYCYGeBtaz1JkBPma2BVJ4o07DXRl8nwEA1I_sTXyxp9NkaAjcI8P8HAQ\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">ARM Tech Con<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> this week (Nov 10-12) at the Santa Clara Convention Center.</p><p><em>Robert Thompson&#xA0;is&#xA0;Chief Enablement Architect for i.MX applications processors</em></p>",

The problem has gotten worse in recent years, and is now considered a global phenomenon.</p><p>The <u><a href=\"https://create.org/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Center for Responsible Enterprise and Trade (CREATe)<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></u>, a non-governmental organization (NGO) that helps companies around the world prevent piracy, counterfeiting, trade-secret theft, and corruption, has researched the issue of counterfeit auto parts and published some chilling facts. According to CREATe:</p><p><strong>What can be done</strong></p><p>One of the ways to combat counterfeiting is to shore up vulnerabilities in the automotive supply chain, so it&#x2019;s harder to introduce fakes into legitimate channels and harder to divert authentic products into grey-market channels.</p><p>Many manufacturers already use RFID tags to track and trace parts through the automotive supply chain, and this helps reduce vulnerability. But a new generation of tags, equipped with functions for secure authentication, offer extra features specifically aimed at combating counterfeits.</p><p><strong>Next-generation RAIN RFID tags</strong></p><p>The new tags are part of NXP&#x2019;s widely used <a href=\"http://nxp-rfid.com/products/ucode\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\"><u>UCODE family of passive RAIN RFID tags</u><u> operating in the UHF frequency range</u><span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>. They use a unique, factory-locked transponder ID (TID) number, for easy product serialization. They also include memory for storing the Electronic Product Code (EPC), to make inventory and warehouse management faster, more efficient, and more accurate. In addition to the EPC memory, they also include user memory for storing valuable product data, such as manufacturer and lot number. The user memory can even be loaded with work-in-progress data, down to the specific operator and machine that built the part.</p><p>The new RAIN RFID tags add several features for increased security. They include a digital signature which offers enhanced electronic protection and can be used as a first alert for counterfeit products.</p><p>Additionally, RAIN RFID tags now also support cryptographic security, including cryptographic product authentication. This represents the highest level of protection because the transactions between the tag and the reader are dynamic and unique every time, always based on cryptographic computations done with the help of secret keys which never leave protected security vault embedded inside the microchip. All of this gives original parts manufacturers high level of certainty that they can effectively and quickly identify fake products which enter into their supply chain.</p><p><strong>Beyond automotive</strong></p><p>The need for increased security in the automotive industry was one of the reasons why NXP developed the new UCODE products, but the tags can, of course, be used to protect products in other supply chains, too, such as fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), luxury items, consumer electronics, and more.</p><p><strong>Join the conversation</strong></p><p>Do you have direct experience with counterfeit products entering the supply chain? What other methods, beyond item tagging and authentication, might manufacturers consider in the fight against fakes?</p><p><strong>Related links</strong></p><p>NXP UCODE products</p><p><a href=\"http://nxp-rfid.com/products/ucode/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">http://nxp-rfid.com/products/ucode/<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p><p>NXP application page for inventory and supply-chain management</p><p><a href=\"http://nxp-rfid.com/applications/inventory-and-supply-chain-management/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">http://nxp-rfid.com/applications/inventory-and-supply-chain-management/<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p>",

      "url": "https://blog.nxp.com/nxp/howto-interrupt-handling-and-debugging-in-kinetis-mcus",
      "content": "<p>Low abstraction level and tight relation between hardware and software makes embedded development a lot more complicated than PC development.</p><p>Often new or inexperienced embedded developers are challenged by interrupt handling &#x2013; also known as interrupt service routines (ISRs) &#x2013; the process of servicing the hardware interrupt.</p><p>Interrupts and exceptions are events generated by the hardware. They can interrupt the application software at any time, and the main software module will not be aware it was interrupted. This causes a large number of problems for embedded developers, who get a number of new complexities to understand and master.</p><p>Common causes for interrupts being triggered may be timers that expire, communications interfaces that receive data bytes, DMA transfers being completed, and so on.</p><p>Interrupts and exceptions are events generated by the hardware</p><p>By connecting a C function to an interrupt source, you can define what software logic is to execute when the interrupt event fires. You need to write an interrupt handler to respond to every type of hardware interrupt that is enabled in the device. The interrupt handlers must then be inserted into the proper place in the vector table so the hardware knows which interrupt handler function to call when each interrupt fires.</p><p>If your application uses a real-time operating system (RTOS), interrupt handling functionality is almost always part of the RTOS. This is for two main reasons:</p><p>If you are writing a bare metal application then you will need to become very familiar with the interrupt mechanisms of the ARM Cortex-M architecture. In the case of our Kinetis MCUs, you&#x2019;ll find an abstraction layer that bare metal applications can use to simplify interrupt handling.</p><p>Here are a few important concepts and facts you will want to remember when working with ARM Cortex-M4 devices</p><p>Getting interrupts to work can be rather tricky, from getting a correctly defined interrupt vector table linked on the right memory addresses, to enabling interrupts properly, and then processing them in an interrupt handler. It all involves advanced topics like linker configuration files, SFR register bit field configuration and manipulation, interrupt #pragmas, possibly inline assembly and more.</p><p><strong>Debugging interrupts and exceptions</strong></p><p>So how do you go about analyzing and debugging the behavior of your interrupts and exceptions on an ARM Cortex-M device like Kinetis? Interrupts and exceptions are by definition asynchronous to the execution flow of your application software and it can be very difficult to visualize interrupt behavior, and debug the same. Fortunately, the ARM Cortex-M core has brilliant hardware support for visualizing and debugging interrupt behavior. This is how to use it.</p><p>To analyze exception and interrupt behavior, the debugger must use the SWD debug mode, and have SWV enabled. Furthermore, the debugger must be configured to enable event tracing for interrupts and exceptions. If you want to use real-time graphical chart plots as well for system analysis visualization, SWV timestamps must be enabled too.</p><p>Configure the debugger to enable event tracing for interrupts and exceptions</p><p>With that basic configuration out of the way, the debugger can be used for real-time system analysis, for example listing all interrupt and exception events that occur as the application is executing at full speed, including exception entry, exception return and exception exit.&#xA0; This enables developers to work out if an interrupt actually fires, how often, and which interrupts intermix over time. It also enables developers to work out any interrupt nesting situations, as well as timing matters. With more capable debuggers like Atollic TrueSTUDIO you can also see what peripheral module generated the interrupt, and what interrupt handler is connected to the interrupt. A double click on the interrupt handler automatically brings you to the right code line in the source code editor as well.</p><p>Debugger provides real-time system analysis, including exception entry, return and exit</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>A graphical chart plot of the interrupt behavior provides an easy-to-understand view of how many interrupts fire over time. This is particularly useful if interrupts are expected to fire in certain patterns.</p><p>Good debuggers also provide you with interrupt statistics information for each interrupt type; listing interesting information such as:</p><p>A good debugger, like <a href=\"https://community.freescale.com/community/iot-center/iot-bom-components/atollic-truestudio-product-page\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Atollic TrueSTUDIO<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, also allows you to double click on any interrupt and jump directly to the source code lines.</p><p><strong>Summary: ARM Cortex-M core based devices, like Kinetis MCUs, offer many compelling capabilities for embedded developers</strong></p><p>Because it&#x2019;s a modern 32-bit processor architecture, many developers are not fully aware of its capabilities and the complexities they bring.</p><p>A key to successful Kinetis development is to understand interrupt handling, and in particular debugging of interrupts and exceptions. A powerful debugger brings capabilities for interrupt and exception tracing, graphical visualization, as well as interrupt timing and statistics and capabilities for runtime error detection using a hard fault crash analyzer.</p>",

NXP technology supports Stella Lux&#x2019;s steering, Heads up Display, solar power system, window and throttle/brake functions amongst others.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s take an in-depth look at two of the most exciting technologies featured in Stella Lux that could be in our own cars soon.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/21676154364_340dde8e11_b.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5024\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/21676154364_340dde8e11_b-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"21676154364_340dde8e11_b\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/21676154364_340dde8e11_b.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/21676154364_340dde8e11_b-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></p><p><strong>V2X communications technology </strong></p><p>Stella Lux is fitted with NXP Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology. This allows it to communicate with the support car following behind, sending important data about the status of the vehicle, battery level, operating temperature etc. This means that the team can combine this data with other sources like weather data to develop predictive models in real time, enabling them to change their strategy as they go.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22116099789_73db09c7e8_b.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5022\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22116099789_73db09c7e8_b-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"22116099789_73db09c7e8_b\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22116099789_73db09c7e8_b.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22116099789_73db09c7e8_b-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></p><p>In the future all cars will feature V2X communications technology. Initially it will be used to communicate with other cars on the road as well as infrastructure like traffic lights and road signs. This will enable drivers to be more aware of their surroundings and be warned of upcoming hazards. This same technology will also form the building blocks of autonomous driving. Instead of sending warnings to the driver, the car will receive these signals and autonomously take action, driving itself and leaving us free to do other tasks.</p><p>The advent of autonomous driving will lead to safer, greener more efficient journeys for everyone.</p><p><strong>RFID license plates</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22193697161_6705aa0b81_b.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5020\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22193697161_6705aa0b81_b-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"22193697161_6705aa0b81_b\" width=\"863\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22193697161_6705aa0b81_b.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22193697161_6705aa0b81_b-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 863px) 100vw, 863px\"></a></p><p>The electric vehicle currently racing across Australia also features an NXP enabled RFID license plate. This plate can be read by special readers that can tell instantly if it is genuine or not. While this has limited applications in the outback it can be very useful in more urban environments.</p><p>There are currently over 40,000 illegal license plates in The Netherlands but this is problem for every country in the world. While counterfeiting a license plate in itself might not be considered a serious crime it hampers police&#x2019;s ability to track down serious criminals using stolen vehicles.</p><p>If cars are fitted with an RFID enabled license plate then this could lead to a dramatic reduction in stolen cars and overall crime. Readers can be installed on roadsides and carried by police which will detect the plate at speed and immediately alert if the plate is not genuine. The chip does not require a battery to operate so they have a very long lifetime.</p><p>Privacy is a big concern when it comes to tracking people&#x2019;s cars so it will be vital that not just any RFID reader can communicate with the license plates. NXP has designed the technology so that only authorised readers can be used, ensuring the privacy and security of road users.</p><p>Field trials are currently taking place so we could see this on the roads in as little as two years.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22332723766_9c32c567c9_b.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5021\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22332723766_9c32c567c9_b-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"22332723766_9c32c567c9_b\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22332723766_9c32c567c9_b.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22332723766_9c32c567c9_b-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></p>",

But, with any revolution, consumers are at the center of it and their needs and wants will ultimately determine how significant and successful Auto IoT will become.</p><p><strong>Auto IoT is expected to drive huge commercial and monetization&#xA0;opportunities</strong><br>\nAuto IoT applications are projected to create huge commercial opportunities by 2020. GSMA Connected Living estimates that 5 of the top 10 connected applications &#x2013; Connected Car, Usage Based Insurance, Car Monitoring &amp; Usage, Traffic Monitoring and Electric Vehicle Charging &#x2013; are attributed to Auto IoT. These are the estimated value of those connected applications in 2020:</p><p>Data source: GSMA Connected Living (2013)</p><p>This monetization of Auto IoT is driven by additional services, value and safety that can be offered to the car owner and reduction in car costs in terms of predictive maintenance, general engineering improvements and insurance.</p><p>For example, the Insurance Research Council estimates <a href=\"http://www.insurance-research.org/research-publications/6\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">that fraudulent claims to the auto insurance industry result in around $7.7 billion<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> in excess payments for auto injury claims in the USA in 2012, and <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/05/22/autos/100-million-recalls\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">100M cars have been recalled in US since start of 2014<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> of the total 254.7 million cars and trucks (yes, that&#x2019;s 4 out of 10).

Auto IoT is expected to breakthrough this behavior and drive fatalities further to zero.</p><p><strong>What technology is required?<br>\n</strong>Connected cars will have many sensors such as radar, vision, ultra-sonic, vehicle to x and future biometric sensors. V2X technology will connect cars to other cars, people and infrastructure. Fusing sensor data from the car&#x2019;s own sensors with data provided from sources external to the car (V2X), will enable the car to understand its complex environment and execute enhanced actions with safety being a priority.</p><p>As the car&#x2019;s own systems become further connected and cars are connected to the IoT, you can argue that the chances of a crash of some function within that chain increases.

The resulting implementation is based on a main sampling loop triggered by a 10ms periodic interrupt timer, with a callback function that executes the measurement algorithm for each sensor. The operation and measurement algorithm for each sensor is briefly described as follows:</p><p>Weather station software design</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Wind vane<br>\n</strong>The wind vane sensor is a voltage divider consisting of a resistor array connected with eight magnetic reed switches. A magnet on the wind vane closes either one or two adjacent switches depending on the wind direction. This produces one of 16 different voltage levels corresponding to 16 discrete compass directions. The voltage is measured on one of the ADC channels and a lookup table is used to translate each voltage range to a corresponding wind direction. However, because the voltage levels do not change monotonically with wind direction we implemented a debounce algorithm to ensure that voltage transitions are not interpreted as an incorrect direction.</p><p>Wind vane voltage divider circuit</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Anemometer<br>\n</strong>The wind speed measurement uses a cup-type anemometer with a magnetic reed switch that generates a pulse with each half rotation. One pulse per second corresponds to a wind speed of 1.492 miles per hour. In order to provide sufficient accuracy over a wide range of wind speeds, the measurement algorithm measures the interval between pulses. A GPIO input channel is configured to trigger an interrupt on the rising edge of each pulse. The interrupt sets a flag that is checked every 10ms by the main measurement loop, and a software counter records the number of 10ms intervals since the previous pulse. If the flag has been set, the wind speed is calculated from the counter value and the counter is reset; if not the counter is simply incremented. This solution provides an error of &lt;10% for wind speeds up to 15 miles per hour and a maximum measurement of 149.2 miles per hour. A 30 second timeout defaults the measured wind speed to zero for wind speeds less than 0.05 mile per hour.</p><p><strong>Rain gauge</strong><br>\nThe rain gauge measures rainfall using a self-emptying bucket with a magnetic reed switch that generates a pulse each time the bucket tips. Each tip of the bucket indicates 0.011 inches of rainfall. Similar to the anemometer, a GPIO input channel is configured to trigger an interrupt on the rising edge of each pulse. A software counter records the number of accumulated pulses and thus the total rainfall. A debounce function eliminates spurious counts from the reed switch.</p><p><strong>Temperature</strong><br>\nThe TMP36 analog temperature sensor was selected to measure ambient air temperature. The sensor is protected from the elements and direct sunlight in a simple housing made from PVC plumbing parts. The temperature sensor is powered by 3.3V DC from the TWR-KW24D512 board and produces an analog output voltage that is linear with temperature. The output voltage is measured on one of the KW24 ADC channels and translated to temperature using specified calibration values.</p><p>During initial testing we noticed some crosstalk between the temperature sensor and wind direction sensors, which are both measured using multiplexed channels on the same ADC. This problem was solved by alternating these measurements between successive 10ms sampling intervals to allow sufficient settling time on the ADC input. In addition, we filtered the measured temperature using a 50 sample moving average to reduce noise.</p><p><strong>Barometer</strong><br>\nThe <a href=\"http://www.freescale.com/products/sensors/pressure-sensors/barometric-pressure-15-to-115-kpa/50-to-115kpa-absolute-digital-pressure-sensor:MPL115A?lang_cd=en\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">MPL115A2<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>&#xA0;absolute digital pressure sensor uses a MEMs pressure sensor and an on-board processor to convert the atmospheric pressure measurement to a 16 bit digital value that is communicated over an I2C interface. The TWRPI-MPL115A2 module is attached to the TWRPI connector on the TWR-KW24D512 board, which is configured to use the I2C interface on the KW24.&#xA0; The MPL115A2 is sampled every 10ms by the main measurement loop, and the measured value is filtered using a 30 sample moving average. An initial setup routine performs calibration of the barometer.<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p><p><strong>Thread Communication<br>\n</strong>Communicating the sensor data over the IEEE 802.15.4 network using Thread was actually one of the easiest parts of this project. The Thread stack implements all the required wireless networking functionality including link configuration and provisioning, network topology management, and security features. All that was needed was to assemble the measurements into a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) string, which is passed to the Thread stack in a single function call.</p><p>The weather station is configured as a Thread Router, which means that it can act as a repeater node in the mesh network as well as a source of sensor data. For this demo we used a USB-KW24D512 configured as the Thread Border Router. The USB-KW24D512 communicates with a Utilite IOT Gateway running Proximetry AirSync agent to send the measurement data to the Proximetry cloud service. The weather station is configured to transmit data once every 15 seconds, although this can easily be changed. The data appears in near-real time on the Proximetry portal, which also provides network status and topology information.</p><p>Ambient pressure: Weather station data on the Proximetry portal</p><p>Ambient temperature: Weather station data on the Proximetry portal</p><p>Wind speed: Weather station data on the Proximetry portal</p><p>Wind direction: Weather station data on the Proximetry portal</p><p>Daily rainfall: Weather station data on the Proximetry portal</p><p>The students completed the weather station design, and we have since built additional demo installations&#xA0;that are being used in customer demos around the world. In the end, this turned out to be a highly rewarding project and the students learned a lot &#x2013; not only about our&#xA0;microcontroller and Thread networking technologies but also about the process of specifying, designing, building, coding, testing and documenting. I can&#x2019;t wait to see the great new IoT &#x201C;Thing&#x201D; they come up with next!</p>",

      "content": "<p>Over 40 teams of students have begun an epic 3000km race from Darwin to Adelaide in specially built solar powered cars.</p><p>One of the teams taking part is the Solar Team Eindhoven, comprised of students from the Eindhoven University of Technology. They have built Stella Lux, a unique solar powered family vehicle using the most advanced technology from NXP and others. On Saturday the car took part in qualifying and topped the group meaning it took the honour of starting on pole position for Sunday&#x2019;s inaugural stage.</p><p>The students are now well on their way, driving by day and camping in the desert at night. Just yesterday Stella Lux became the first solar-powered family car ever to drive 1500km on one single charge.</p><p>Each day the challenge starts at 8am and the students have until 5pm to go as far as they can before setting up camp in the outback. The next day they start again from where they left off.</p><p>We had a quick chat with Tom Selten from Solar Team Eindhoven about the car and the challenge.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22111426208_89fd30a3ee_b.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5011\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22111426208_89fd30a3ee_b-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"22111426208_89fd30a3ee_b\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22111426208_89fd30a3ee_b.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22111426208_89fd30a3ee_b-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></p><p><strong><em>You&#x2019;ve been driving around Australia for a few days now, what has the public reaction been to Stella?</em></strong></p><p>They&#x2019;re quite amazed I think. The car we&#x2019;ve built, Stella Lux, is one of the most spectacular cars in the race. It&#x2019;s a four person vehicle, the only one in the whole challenge. Compared to the previous Stella we&#x2019;ve done a really good job of the interior. Sitting in it is much more like a normal car.</p><p><strong><em>How well is the new Stella driving?</em></strong></p><p>We can drive pretty fast, we have a really efficient car. We have made lots of aerodynamic improvements compared to the last model and we&#x2019;re also able to generate much more energy from the sun. We can generate 1.5 Kilowatt hours which is the same as our usage, meaning we could drive non-stop in the sun at around 70 km/h.</p><p><strong><em>How much work was there for the team in the lead up to the challenge?</em></strong></p><p>A lot of work! Not just on the car but we are constantly working on improving the strategy. We want the battery to be empty when we finish so it&#x2019;s very similar to F1 in the way we plan each stage. We use NXP technology to constantly send data between Stella and the support car so we can adapt our strategy in real time.</p><p><strong><em>What kind of support have you received from NXP for the World Solar Challenge?</em></strong></p><p>We&#x2019;ve received great support from NXP. They supplied the technology for Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technology and many of the controllers in the car are based on NXP chips. NXP is also helping us take Stella across the world to show the potential of our technology. Soon we&#x2019;ll be in China showing people the possibilities of solar powered car, which is a fantastic opportunity.</p><p><strong><em>So when will we see Stella type solar cars with ordinary consumers behind the wheel?</em></strong></p><p>I think we&#x2019;re ready but people need to adapt their attitudes and learn that we don&#x2019;t need petroleum anymore and we don&#x2019;t need as much power &#x2013; Stella only uses as much as a dryer, which is crazy.</p><p>People are very used to the concept of a car, engine in the front, trunk in the back etc. but a car like Stella looks very different and people will have to get used to these concepts.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22050549300_f20594fcec_b.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5010\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22050549300_f20594fcec_b-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"22050549300_f20594fcec_b\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22050549300_f20594fcec_b.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/22050549300_f20594fcec_b-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></p><p>Next time we get under the hood and have a look at what technology makes Stella Lux tick.

But that&#x2019;s not always the case.

This gives rise to an ecosystem of client authentication methods such as biometrics, PINs and second&#x2013;factors that can be used with a variety of online services in an interoperable manner.</p><p>Volansys has developed two applications running on the i.MX6 IoT Gateway. They are CGI handler and Proxy Server. Both these applications were developed in &#x2018;c&#x2019; and run on Linux platform compiled for i.MX6.</p><p>The CGI Handler is responsible for handling all HTTP GET/POST request/response to access door lock. All requests are generated from FIDO client running on Android Application. It receives HTTP GET/POST request and sends the requested data to Proxy Server. Proxy Server is the only component that is responsible for sending commands to the kinetics bridge which in turn controls the lock associated with itself over the Bluetooth.</p><p>The Proxy Server is responsible for looking over FIDO authentication using FIDO server library.&#xA0; Whenever Proxy server receives data from CGI handler, it performs FIDO authentication. After successful FIDO authentication, Proxy Server sends lock control commands to Kinetis Bridge and receives the lock status response from the bridge. After receiving lock status, it notifies the Proximetry agent about the lock status and sends response back to android app through the CGI handler. Proxy server also handles the lock control commands from Proximetry agent. All the communications between android app, proxy server and Proximetry agent are in predefined format.</p><p>FIDO products and services erase the necessity of using passwords for security by adding FIDO U2F second-factor devices. Password usage can also be completely eliminated through FIDO UAF biometric solutions such as fingerprint or iris recognition sensors.&#xA0; If biometric data is used by a FIDO authenticator, the biometric information is securely stored in the device.</p><p>For more information for how you can leverage the FIDO libraries used in the prototype, please visit <a href=\"https://community.freescale.com/community/iot-center/demos/volansys-iot-demo\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">the IoT Center<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> or let me know.</p><p><strong><em>Bill Krakar is an IoT software product manager</em></strong></p>",

      "content": "<p>In today&#x2019;s world filled with cell phones, tablets and other smart devices, operators are on the hot seat to manage network services quickly in order to avoid a slow and overloaded network. Software-defined networking (SDN) is generating a lot of attention, mainly as a tool to provide the flexibility and programmability needed to do just that. While the hype around its possibilities is here, is SDN ready for primetime? Technically, yes. But there is a problem, which isn&#x2019;t related to the technology, but rather with the people who must manage this change.</p><p>The enterprise network has been dominated by trusted OEMs that provided full support for their equipment with its complicated embedded software. SDN helps the network break free of this dominating vendor lock-in by offering bare metal switches, which have the programmability to control and change various parts of the network in order to offer increased flexibility to the network operators. But this also shifts the ownership of network solutions from the OEMs that designed the software and hardware of the traditional network to the operators, presenting operators with a new area to manage, new responsibilities and a whole new set of programming rules to learn.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ManvMachine_1-1024x768.jpg\" alt width=\"900\">This puts added pressure on the operators and carries a lot of risk for them, making the value proposition for SDN less clear. This is particularly true for the enterprise, although many telecom carriers and cloud data centers are already making adjustments to change their business model accordingly. Many enterprises are seeking ways to reduce this risk by looking for software that will manage their SDN for them. But this creates the same vendor lock-in that SDN is seeking to eliminate. Instead, the industry should work together to create a way for operators to fully control the network within an interface that they are already familiar with. Then, while an SDN expert might be required to deploy an SDN system, an easy-to-use interface could be used to control the network&#x2019;s behavior. This places operators firmly in control without requiring them to learn an entirely new programming skillset or to hire a fleet of SDN experts.</p><p>Solving these SDN adoption issues likely involves restructuring IT boundaries and an emergence of trusted software solutions in order to enable operators to regain control of network configuration in light of their newfound hardware independence. Doing so will be well worth the effort as the network&#x2019;s programmability and flexibility allows companies to deploy new services, eliminate slow traffic and create a better user experience for both employees and customers.</p>",

      "content": "<p>It is crucial for designers of electronic systems to protect every product against the destructive forces of ESD. Systems, components and interfaces are all at risk, especially as chip geometries continue to shrink and data speeds get faster. Innovative products often bring with them new demands and fresh challenges requiring new solutions. One such case is the latest USB interface standard, which brings faster data rates and the new USB Type-C connector.</p><p><strong>New level of protection</strong></p><p>For USB 3.1 a new level of ESD protection is necessary, mostly because of its very high 10 Gbps data rate. Table 1 provides a summary of recent USB standards and their maximum data rates. At double that of USB 3.0, the fast data rate makes it more difficult to maintain signal integrity. For example, the small inherent capacitance of ESD protection diodes becomes a contributing factor in potential signal disturbances. Also, the smaller structures of fast systems tend to be more sensitive to ESD, demanding a more robust ESD solution.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Capture.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-4999 alignnone\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Capture.jpg\" alt=\"Capture\" width=\"565\" height=\"147\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Capture.jpg 565w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Capture-300x78.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px\"></a></p><p><em>Table 1: Summary of USB maximum data rates</em></p><p>With our new TrEOS Protection device family we have achieved a higher level of ESD protection, ideal for the USB 3.1 interface. It offers an industry-benchmark combination of low capacitance, high system-level robustness and low clamping voltage.</p><p><strong>Meeting signal integrity requirements</strong></p><p>Capacitances of TrEOS devices are in the 0.3 pF range for uni-directional devices, while bi-directional devices offer capacitances down to only 0.1 pF. Low capacitances alone are not sufficient to achieve a system with good signal integrity. Signal lines should be as short and symmetrical as possible, and stubs avoided. NXP offers package concepts, which support RF-friendly routing.</p><p>This post offers just a taste of what you can find in our new technical white paper &#x2018;ESD protection for USB 3.1 &amp; Type-C&#x2019;: It gives you an in-depth analysis, considering how the changes to this popular interface relate to the challenges of protecting USB 3.1 products from ESD strikes.

      "content": "<p><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Security-image.jpg\" alt width=\"460\" height=\"306\">Open source SDN could be scary. Especially after Heartbleed, Shellshock and the recent FREAK scare, people are understandably leery of the security of open source. There is a bit of a mystique that opening up the software programmable interface to anyone that wants to come in and code makes the code vulnerable and open to manipulations.</p><p>But in reality, an open programming model, like the one being embraced by the Open Networking Foundation (ONF), is actually more secure, particularly in the context of SDN. SDN provides one the ability to recognize and pin point a problem quickly and then quarantine and apply measures to address it. In a threat environment that&#x2019;s constantly changing, one needs a network that can evolve as fixes are made and also stay ahead of conceivable future threats.</p><p>Increased visibility into the code base also makes it easier to address issues. While it will be ignorant to say that there isn&#x2019;t a potential for problems like those associated with FREAK and other vulnerabilities, it&#x2019;s difficult for me to believe that these were deliberately architected into the software without anyone noticing. We all know that one of the key advantages of open source is that someone is always watching the code and keeping everyone honest. Instead, I believe that these vulnerabilities were simply an oversight that the bad guys found and exploited.</p><p>On the contrary, when a hole is exploited in a fixed system, it&#x2019;s a lot harder to address the problem. It&#x2019;s hard to update the embedded software, so if a problem arises, there really isn&#x2019;t a quick way to stop it. Because SDN infrastructure is not fixed in time, there&#x2019;s increased flexibility to fight attacks. As an example, it wasn&#x2019;t too long ago that the U.S. and Chinese government were trading accusations about whether one had built deliberate backdoors into the networking equipment being bought by the other. While the truth of these accusations is a discussion for another time, the bare facts are that in a traditional network, this sort of deviousness is very possible.</p><p>In a flexible and programmable SDN network, on the other hand, one can break the linkage between the software and hardware vendors. One can run whatever software one wants, choosing the amount of visibility one wants to offer into the software and how much one trusts that software to not have built-in backdoors. Or one could even go into the software itself to close any vulnerabilities one might find.</p><p>SDN holds a huge potential to increase network security. Due to its open, flexible, programmable nature, it may not seem secure on its surface, but beneath that fa&#xE7;ade is the ability to find and close security vulnerabilities quickly and easily, particularly when compared to traditional, fixed networks.</p>",

The data provided directly from an individual to a trusted partner can be obtained in a process that builds trust, loyalty and long-term relationship while avoiding the often erroneous information obtained by third-party data brokers.</p><p>As an example of how this trusted relationship might work, let&#x2019;s consider NXP&#x2019;s idea of, <a title=\"Me &amp; My Smarter World\" href=\"http://mobileworldcongress.nxp.com/2015/about/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Me and My Smarter World<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>. The semiconductors, sensors, and technological framework NXP is building provides the nervous system that power the Internet of Things that invisibly swirls around us as we live our lives. Having a Personal Cloud and Life Management Platform for our digital identity will serve as a form of &#x201C;activity translator&#x201D; within this environment where our &#x201C;Human API&#x201D; can communicate with any technology tracking our lives. In terms of increasing our wellbeing, here are some simple examples of how these future interactions might work:</p><p>For all of these examples and any others you can dream up, remember it&#x2019;s up to you to create the context for your digital identity that will make your Smarter World most relevant and beneficial to you. Where you control your data and how your Life Management Platform interacts with any outside sensor or device, you&#x2019;ll be <em>connected on purpose</em> so you can increase your wellbeing based on the transformative insights our digital identities will provide.</p>",

At the time, we were contributing our sensor fusion library to the <a href=\"https://github.com/memsindustrygroup/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">MIG GitHub site<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>. Kionix and&#xA0;PNI Sensor Corp. have contributed to the site, and today we are&#xA0;making another contribution in the form of our trajectory simulation library.</p><p>When my team first started exploring <a href=\"http://www.freescale.com/sensorfusion\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">sensor fusion<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> topics a few years ago, we needed some way to validate the results of the algorithms we were looking at. This was before the company had a <a href=\"http://www.freescale.com/products/sensors/gyroscopes:GYROSCOPE?cof=0&amp;am=0\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">gyro<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, and we didn&#x2019;t have any kind of motion capture system available to us. So, we started investigating simulation capabilities. We wanted something where we could programmatically define a 6DOF trajectory of an object, including translation in X,Y,Z space, as well as full rotation. Then we needed sensor models that would take that simulated motion and generate simulated sensor readings. Those could then be used as inputs of our sensor fusion simulations. The outputs of those simulations could then be compared with the original trajectory orientation data to see how well we did.</p><p>We&#xA0;found a few tools in the literature, but could not use them for one reason or another.&#xA0;The <a href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5779038&amp;tag=1\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">IMUSim tool by A.D. Young, M.J. Ling and D.K. Arvind<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>&#xA0;was of particular interest, but&#xA0;we had trouble replicating the required software environment. We needed something that could easily be transferred to other engineers, and decided to write&#xA0;our own <a href=\"http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Matlab<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a><sup>TM</sup> library to do the job. The result was a library of routines that I collectively refer to as TSim&#xA0;(short for trajectory SIMulator).</p><p>The basic idea is to have a good&#xA0;library of&#xA0;functions and canned routines&#xA0;that can easily be pulled together to succinctly specify motion in six dimensions. The program listing below shows how I cobbled together the definition for the motion you see animated at the top of this posting.</p><p>The listing includes two tables. One defines data points of position and time. The other specifies angular velocity versus time. You probably recall from your college physics 101 that&#xA0;acceleration is the&#xA0;derivative of velocity which is the&#xA0;derivative of position. Specify any one of the three, and the other two can (within a constant value) also be determined. Angular acceleration, velocity and orientation work the same way.</p><p>You might think that these tables are pretty crude, but that would be ignoring the power that Matlab gives us to interpolate between points.&#xA0; We used a spline function above to create the smooth trajectory shown below.</p><p><img style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/construction2.png\" alt=\"construction2\" width=\"650\" height=\"488\"></p><p>The basic components of a simulation are:</p><p>Because this is a very constrained problem, we&#x2019;re able to encapsulate most of the work in the trajectory library itself. That short listing above was all it took to define the trajectory, dump sensor outputs and create the animation above.</p><p><img style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ClassHierarchy1.png\" alt=\"ClassHierarchy1\" width=\"400\"></p><p>The TSim library makes heavy use of object oriented programming. Trajectory object construction is shown above.&#xA0;&#xA0; Integration of those trajectories with sensor models is shown below.</p><p><img style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ClassHierarchy2.png\" alt=\"ClassHierarchy2\" width=\"400\"></p><p>The whole mess is documented in gory detail in the TSim user manual, which is included in the distribution, which you can download now at <a href=\"https://github.com/memsindustrygroup/TSim\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">https://github.com/memsindustrygroup/TSim<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>.</p><p>We used TSim as a testbench to characterize our 4.x sensor fusion libraries last year, and are planning to repeat the process for the recently announced 5.00 fusion libraries in coming months. Our goal is that by making the library open, we can&#xA0;encourage the sensor fusion community to use a common&#xA0;collection of stimulus/response datasets for characterization purposes.</p><p>And if you would like to know more about the MIG Accelerated Innovation Community, please just drop me a line.

This was followed by my <a href=\"http://beheerportaal.blog.nxp.com/the-accidental-thermal-engineer-top-clip/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">September post<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> &#x2018;Top Clip&#x2019; where I took the idea of a detailed die model further, showing how a top clip could be added to a standard D2PAK device in order to improve the thermal performance of the device over a specific time range. This D2PAK case was a purely hypothetical example. So in this post I would like to look at some real devices that use a package which <em>does</em> have a top clip, NXP&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/products/mosfets/standard_mosfets/family/LFPAK56_MOSFETS/#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">LFPAK56<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, and see how the thermal performance would be affected if the top clip was not present.</p><p>Before I come to that, I&#x2019;d first like to introduce the concept of &#x2018;transient thermal impedance&#x2019;. Transient thermal impedance graphs, also known as &#x2018;Z<sub>th</sub> curves&#x2019; (zed-theta curves), are a convenient way of describing time-dependent thermal behaviour without referring to specific power levels or temperature rises. If you&#x2019;re not already familiar with Z<sub>th</sub> curves then I urge you to take a look at our <a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/documents/application_note/AN11156.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Application note &#x2013; Using Power MOSFET Z<sub>th</sub> Curves<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, and in particular the worked example in Section 2.1. I&#x2019;ll wait a minute for you to do that&#x2026; OK, so now we&#x2019;re all comfortable with the idea of Z<sub>th</sub> curves, let&#x2019;s return to the LFPAK56.</p><p>If you look at our focused package page on NXP.com, <a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/products/mosfets/standard_mosfets/family/LFPAK56_MOSFETS/#overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">LFPAK56 &#x2013; The toughest power-SO8<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, in the section &#x2018;Innovative clip-bonding&#x2019; you&#x2019;ll see an exploded view of the package, which is also shown below.

      "content": "<p><img style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Figure-3-sensor-placement-in-car-for-movement-detection.png\" alt width=\"900\" height></p><p>Ever thought about using magnetometers to detect the presence of a huge metallic mass like a car? Is it a simple concept like proximity sensing using magnetic field? Well, the answer to that question is a simple yes, but, the concept as such is tricky as one would expect it to be.</p><p>As we all know magnetometers detect the strength of the magnetic field exposed to it. Since earth is like a huge bar magnet itself, we use magnetometers to detect this field and derive meaningful information out of it &#x2013; a simple solution is a compass app in your smart phones. Earth&#x2019;s magnetic field range is in the order of 25 &#x2013; 65 &#xB5;T (micro-tesla).</p><p><b>Magnetic tunnel junction sensors<br>\n</b>Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) based sensors (like the ones from Freescale &#x2013;FXOS8700CQ and MAG3110) can detect such low magnetic fields strengths with high sensitivity unlike Hall Effect sensors whose measurement range lies in mT (milli tesla) region. In MTJ based sensors, the sensing mechanism consists of two layers &#x2013; the &#x201C;pinned&#x201D; magnetic layer (fixed magnetic orientation in a specific direction) and the &#x201C;free&#x201D; sense layer to follow the orientation of the applied field. This modulates the measured resistance in a wheatstone based configuration (as shown in figure 1) thereby the measured output voltage.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><img style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Figure-1-Magnetic-Tunnel-Junction.png\" alt=\"Tunnel Junction\" width=\"651\" height=\"333\"></p><p>Figure 1 Magnetic Tunnel Junction based magnetometers from Freescale</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><b>Concept of vehicle detection</b><br>\nNow let us see how detecting the change in earth&#x2019;s magnetic field is going to help us towards our goal of vehicle presence detection.</p><p><b>Earth&#x2019;s magnetic field line distribution<br>\n</b>Magnetic field lines identify the direction of the magnetic field around the magnetic substance. Figure 2 shows earth&#x2019;s magnetic field lines distribution.&#xA0; It just resembles field lines around a simple bar magnet. As seen in the figure, earth&#x2019;s magnetic field lines are uniform in distribution at any specific place. However the angle of incidence of the field lines onto the surface of the earth varies from poles (90 &#x30A;) to the equator (0 &#x30A;).</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><img style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Figure-2-Earth-Magnetic-Field.png\" alt=\"Magnetosphere\" width=\"320\" height=\"300\"></p><p>Figure 2 Earth&#x2019;s magnetic field1</p><p><b>Field Distortion by ferrous metals<br>\n</b>It is possible to distort this uniform field (figure 3) by placing a &#x2018;highly permeable&#x2019; metal in this field. By highly-permeable, we mean that this category of ferrous metals allows maximum amount of flux lines corresponding to an external magnetic field to pass through them. Or in other words, we can easily magnetize them by exposing to an external applied magnetic field. As shown in figure 3 when the metallic body (ferrous) of the car cuts through the earth&#x2019;s field, the flux lines are absorbed into the metal, creating non-uniformity in the flux line distribution. Depending upon the concentration of the metal, the magnetic flux lines are absorbed more or less and thereby distorting the field lines as shown.</p><p><img style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Figure-3-sensor-placement-in-car-for-movement-detection.png\" alt=\"Sensor Placement\" width=\"678\" height=\"262\"></p><p>Figure 3 Earth&#x2019;s magnetic field lines distorted by ferrous metal of the car</p><p>Now imagine that a magnetometer placed in this field as shown in Figure 3. Before the vehicle approaches the sensor, the sensor would experience uniform field. However as the vehicle passes over the sensor it distorts the earth&#x2019;s magnetic field and creates regions of increased flux line concentration and decreased flux line concentration. The sensor captures this variable pattern as the vehicle passes through as shown in figure 4. The resulting time series graph or a &#x201C;signature&#x201D; identifies the fact that a vehicle had passed through a sensor. In fact, we can even obtain &#x201C;directional&#x201D; information as well if you observe the signature closely.</p><p><img style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Figure-4-magentic-field-strength.png\" alt=\"Field Strength\" width=\"652\" height=\"256\"></p><p>Figure 4 Signature obtained as the vehicle passes through the magnetic sensor</p><p>Ok, now that we have understood the basic concept behind vehicle detection, in the next series we can discuss more about the ideal sensor placements and some of the hurdles towards vehicle detection using magnetometers.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Aswin Sivakumar is a Systems and Applications Engineer in the Sensors division.</p><p><b>References:</b></p><p>Figure source : TStein (Own work) [CC BY-SA 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0) or GFDL (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html)], via Wikimedia Commons</p>",

      "content": "<p><em>Please see below for the German version of this post.</em></p><p><strong>Creating Impetus for a Secure Internet of Things</strong></p><p>The world is becoming an increasingly networked place, and this trend is being accompanied by a growth in the number of threats we face from data manipulation and theft, attacks from criminal hackers, and even state intelligence services. This affects companies, infrastructures and private users alike. According to the latest surveys, half of all Internet users do not regard their data as secure on the Internet &#x2013; an alarming statistic. For businesses, customer trust is just as much a foundation of their business models as it is for the digital communication and transactions engaged in by citizens. The use of encryption and other protective mechanisms is vital to guaranteeing network security. In this sphere companies have a high degree of responsibility for ensuring that such technologies are available to everybody in readily usable form.</p><p>As a technology developer with several years of expertise in the secure connections market, NXP is advocating a change of perspective in this environment: one which places data protection and the security of end customers and users at the heart of the networked world.</p><p>NXP continually engages with representatives from science, industry, politics, associations and organizations in publicly discussing its proposals for regulations to protect users and their data in the Internet of Things. As part of this engagement, NXP has created the communications platform &#x201C;Me&amp;My Smarter World&#x201D;. The most recent example of this series was the panel discussion <a href=\"http://beheerportaal.blog.nxp.com/iaa-frankfurt-new-mobility-world-2015/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Smart and Secure &#x2013; How to protect Drivers and their Data<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, which took place at this year&#x2019;s IAA motor show in Frankfurt. Here, NXP discussed data security with Andy Greenberg, writer of the Wired article on the Chrysler Jeep hack; Dr Tobias Miethaner, Head of the Digital Society Department at the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure; plus other representatives from business, industry and specialist media.</p><p>Please find more information on Certified Security in the Internet of Things <a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Whitepaper-on-Certified-Security-in-the-Internet-of-Things_3.2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">here</a>.</p><p>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p><p><strong>Impulse f&#xFC;r ein sicheres Internet der Dinge</strong></p><p>Mit der fortschreitenden Vernetzung der Welt w&#xE4;chst auch die Zahl der Bedrohungen durch Manipulationen, Datendiebst&#xE4;hle und Angriffe krimineller Hacker und staatlicher Nachrichtendienste auf Unternehmen, Infrastrukturen und die Privatsph&#xE4;re von Nutzern. Laut aktuellen Umfragen h&#xE4;lt die H&#xE4;lfte der Internetnutzerinnen und -nutzer ihre Daten im Netz nicht f&#xFC;r sicher. Das ist alarmierend: Denn f&#xFC;r die Wirtschaft ist das Vertrauen der Kundinnen und Kunden ebenso Grundlage ihrer Gesch&#xE4;ftsmodelle wie f&#xFC;r die digitale Kommunikation und Transaktionen der B&#xFC;rgerinnen und B&#xFC;rger. Der Einsatz von Verschl&#xFC;sselungs- und anderen Schutzmechanismen ist erforderlich, um die Sicherheit im Netz zu gew&#xE4;hrleisten. Dabei kommt den Unternehmen ein hohes Ma&#xDF; an Verantwortung zu, um solche Techniken einfach nutzbar f&#xFC;r jedermann anzubieten.</p><p>NXP als Technologieentwickler und langj&#xE4;hrige Experten im Markt f&#xFC;r sichere Verbindungen tritt vor diesem Hintergrund f&#xFC;r einen Perspektivwechsel ein, der den Schutz der Daten und die Anonymit&#xE4;t der Endkunden und Anwender in den Mittelpunkt der vernetzten Welt stellt.</p><p>&#x2022; <strong>Umfassender Schutz der Privatsph&#xE4;re</strong><br>\nDas offene Netzwerk, in dem Menschen und Dinge kommunizieren, zeigt eine hohe Verletzlichkeit. Erzeugung und Austausch von Daten lassen sich immer mit dem Menschen als Nutzer verbinden, mit seiner Identit&#xE4;t. Gelangen diese pers&#xF6;nlichen Daten in die falschen H&#xE4;nde oder werden sie verf&#xE4;lscht oder besch&#xE4;digt, drohen Gefahren wie die Verletzung der Privatsph&#xE4;re und der informationellen Selbstbestimmung, die Erstellung von Nutzerprofilen oder das Aussp&#xE4;hen oder Manipulieren von Daten (Betrug, Angriffe).</p><p>Wirksame Sicherheitskonzepte f&#xFC;r die vernetzte Welt m&#xFC;ssen vielmehr den Schutz der Daten und die Anonymit&#xE4;t der Endkunden und Anwender in den Mittelpunkt stellen. Die Integrit&#xE4;t von Information aus der vernetzten Welt &#x2013; von Ger&#xE4;ten, Dingen und Sensoren, mit denen der Mensch im Austausch steht &#x2013; muss dazu jederzeit gew&#xE4;hrleistet sein. Zum Schutz der Nutzerrechte (informationelle Selbstbestimmung, Datensouver&#xE4;nit&#xE4;t, Privatheit) sind &#x201E;menschliche&#x201C; Identit&#xE4;ten aber in jedem Fall von Ger&#xE4;teidentit&#xE4;ten zu entkoppeln. Ein Beispiel f&#xFC;r eine solche Anonymisierungstechnologie ist die in der Fahrzeugkommunikation (V2X) verwendete IEEE 1609-Norm, nach der Fahrzeuge bei Kommunikationsvorg&#xE4;ngen immer neue &#x201E;Pseudoidentit&#xE4;ten&#x201C; verwenden. Dadurch entf&#xE4;llt die M&#xF6;glichkeit, den Weg eines Autofahrers anhand der immer gleich bleibenden Identit&#xE4;t seines Fahrzeugs zu verfolgen.</p><p>&#x2022; <strong>Datensouver&#xE4;nit&#xE4;t sichern</strong><br>\nSchutz vor unerw&#xFC;nschtem Datenfl&#xFC;ssen ist in der umfassend vernetzten Welt des Internets der Dinge besonders wichtig. Die Menschen und Unternehmen selbst m&#xFC;ssen die absolute Hoheit dar&#xFC;ber behalten, wer welche Daten aus den von ihnen genutzten Ger&#xE4;ten abrufen kann. Dies setzt voraus, dass absolut zweifelsfrei erkennbar ist, welches andere Ger&#xE4;t von au&#xDF;en auf die internen Daten zugreifen will. Wer beispielsweise sein vernetztes Smart Home von seinem Smartphone aus steuert, muss sicher sein k&#xF6;nnen, dass es Dritten unm&#xF6;glich ist, sich nicht ebenfalls einen Zugang zu seinen Daten und Ger&#xE4;ten zu verschaffen.</p><p>&#x2022; <strong>Datensicherheit und Datenschutz gehen Hand in Hand</strong><br>\nVernetzte Ger&#xE4;te sind so auszugestalten, dass Manipulationen ihrer digitalen Identit&#xE4;t ausgeschlossen oder zumindest maximal erschwert werden (Security by Design). Gleichzeitig ist dabei sicherzustellen, dass die Anonymit&#xE4;t des Nutzers gewahrt bleibt. Hier m&#xFC;ssen die verf&#xFC;gbaren Privacy-by-design Technologien zur Anonymisierung des Anweders und zum Schutz seiner Privatsph&#xE4;re angewendet werden (z.B. Multiple Schl&#xFC;ssel, Anonymous Attestation und Zero-Knowledge Protokolle).</p><p>&#x2022; <strong>Verifizierbare Sicherheitsstandards</strong><br>\nUm eine m&#xF6;glichst hohe Verbindlichkeit beim Einsatz der genannten Schutzmechanismen im Internet der Dinge zu erreichen, bedarf es verifizierbarer Mindestsicherheitsstandards. Eine unabh&#xE4;ngige Pr&#xFC;finstanz &#x2013; eine Art &#x201E;Security-T&#xDC;V&#x201C; &#x2013; kann auf dieser Grundlage die Umsetzung und Einhaltung der Standards garantieren. Dies k&#xE4;me nicht nur dem Sicherheitsniveau im IoT zu Gute, sondern w&#xFC;rde auch das Vertrauen von Unternehmen und Verbrauchern in die verwendeten Technologien st&#xE4;rken.</p><p>NXP diskutiert seine Vorschl&#xE4;ge f&#xFC;r Regelungen zum Schutz von Anwendern und deren Daten im Internet der Dinge immer wieder &#xF6;ffentlich mit Vertretern aus Wissenschaft, Industrie, Politik, Gesellschaft und Verb&#xE4;nden. Dazu hat NXP die Kommunikationsplattform &#x201E;Me&amp;My Smarter World&#x201C; geschaffen. J&#xFC;ngstes Event in dieser Veranstaltungsreihe war das Panel Smart and Secure &#x2013; How to protect Drivers and their Data w&#xE4;hrend der diesj&#xE4;hrigen IAA in Frankfurt, auf der NXP das Thema Datensicherheit mit Andy Greenberg, dem Autor des Wired-Beitrags &#xFC;ber den Chrysler Jeep Hack, Dr. Tobias Miethaner, Leiter der Abteilung Digitale Gesellschaft im Bundesverkehrsministerium sowie weiteren Vertretern aus Wirtschaft, Industrie und Fachmedien diskutiert hat.</p><p>Mehr Informationen zu zertifizierter Sicherheit im Internet der Dinge finden Sie <a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Eckpunktepapier-f&#xFC;r-zertifizierte-Sicherheit-im-Internet-der-Dinge_3.2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">hier</a>.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/A.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"wp-image-4766 size-medium alignnone\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/A-300x200.jpg\" alt width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/A-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/A.jpg 922w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"></a></p><p>During the Panel Discussion <em>Smart and Secure &#x2013; How to protect Drivers and their Data</em> at this year&#x2019;s IAA motor show // W&#xE4;hrend der Diskussionsrunde <em>Smart and Secure &#x2013; How to protect Drivers and their Data</em> auf der diesj&#xE4;hrigen IAA in Frankfurt: from right to left // v.l.n.r.: Dr. Thomas Wollinger, Managing Director, Escrypt; Lars Reger, CTO Automotive, NXP; Dr. Daniel Hobohm, Global Head of Product Lifecycle Management &#x2013; Intelligent Transport Systems, Siemens AG; Markus Albers, Managing Partner, Rethink.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/B.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4767 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/B-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"B\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/B-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/B.jpg 921w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"></a></p><p>Dr. Mathias Wagner, Chief Security Technologist, NXP, at the Panel Discussion <em>Smart and Secure &#x2013; How to protect Drivers and their Data</em> at this year&#x2019;s IAA motor show in Frankfurt. // Dr. Mathias Wagner, Chief Security Technologist, NXP, auf der Veranstaltung <em>Smart and Secure &#x2013; How to protect Drivers and their Data</em> auf der diesj&#xE4;hrigen IAA in Frankfurt.</p>",

      "content": "<p>A few months ago when a new restaurant opened in my small town, a natural sense of curiosity overcame me and so I headed there for dinner with some friends. The ambience was comfortable and the food was fresh. Everything was new, including the point of sale (POS) machine. When I asked the owner if he had considered getting a POS machine with a chip card reader, he said he didn&#x2019;t know anything about it. And, while I work day-in and day-out talking, reading and discussing chip cards and EMV, it still stunned me that a new restaurant owner was unaware of the technology and the liability shift coming to the U.S. in October.</p><p>It turns out this small business owner isn&#x2019;t alone, I continued my very unscientific (but tasty) research over the next few weeks by asking restaurant owners and those working the POS machines if they were aware of the liability shift. I found that many Americans remain unaware of the EMV liability shift even though credit card companies, POS machine vendors and others are talking about it quite often.</p><p>In an effort to further educate small and medium-sized businesses and consumers about the liability shift, NXP hosted an hour-long Twitter discussion, #EMVChat on September 17. With our partners at Verifone, Visa and The Smart Card Alliance we sought to build a better understanding of what the shift means for everyone through the Twitter chat.</p><p>Using the Twitter handles @Verifone, @SmartCardOrgUSA, @VisaSecurity and @nxp_id_business, we discussed how chip technology is an evolution that will help increase security, reduce card-present fraud and enable future value-added applications. Chip-enabled cards are standard bank cards that are embedded with a micro-computer chip. In October, all merchants must be chip card ready if they want to stay protected due to the liability shift. With this chat, our goal was to help educate the community on EMV technology and create an open forum to discuss the future of payments.</p><p>Below is a recap of the chat in case you missed

The new i.MX 8 family incorporates those same key attributes but extends them into realms the industry has never experienced &#x2014; it&#x2019;s poised to revolutionize interactivity.</p><p>i.MX 8 incorporates innovations in the processor &#x2014;&#xA0;complex graphics, vision, virtualization and safety to help revolutionize interactivity for a wide range of uses in many, many markets. The capabilities of this family is broad, so let&#x2019;s focus that innovation down to something familiar to all of us: your car. Here&#x2019;s what the next generation cars, powered by i.MX 8, can bring to you.</p><p><strong>Connect to your car data in the multimedia &#x201C;e-cockpit&#x201D; powered by i.MX 8<br>\n</strong><img class=\"alignright\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/shutterstock_3047676352.jpg\" alt width=\"364\" height=\"243\">As the driver, you connect with your car in multiple ways.&#xA0; You process information given by the infotainment, dashboard, telematics systems and camera systems, all while keeping your eyes on the road.</p><p>This multimedia centric e-cockpit will revolve around the i.MX 8, a single chip that drives all displays from infotainment to heads-up-displays (HUD) to instrument clusters. It&#x2019;s optimized for the intelligent transfer of data and information management from multiple subsystems within the IC &#x2013; as opposed to only delivering raw performance through one or two processing blocks.</p><p>So what can you expect in this new world of the e-cockpit?</p><p><strong>Deliver safety features that automotive OEMs require<br>\n</strong>Passenger safety is a critical feature of the e-cockpit. You&#x2019;ll keep your eyes forward on the road through advanced heads-up displays, intuitive gesture control and natural speech recognition.</p><p>You can significantly increase performance and deliver safety features that automotive OEMs require for next-generation systems using our approach to vision processing, graphics rendering and audio acceleration.</p><p>A hand wave command can change the radio station using i.MX 8 powered cameras inside the car. Passengers in the back seat will turn on the air conditioning via voice commands using built-in microphones.</p><p>These same cameras will soon be sophisticated enough to detect and recognize objects and people in the vehicle. This has tremendous safety implications. It could alert a sleepy driver to stay awake and it could even help stop a thief from starting your vehicle &#x2013; all via facial recognition.</p><p><strong>Get fail-safe reliable display of critical information &#x2013; even if the OS crashes<br>\n</strong>Let&#x2019;s face it, we&#x2019;ve all come to live with a lower level of reliability from our mobile devices because of their utility in our everyday lives. Automotive OEMs are pursuing similar software technologies in their infotainment systems to deliver similar levels of utility and convenience.</p><p>However, in the event of a software crash, you still need to display critical information to the driver &#x2013; speed, gear selection, fuel level, cameras, etc. The i.MX 8 series allows this information to display to the driver even in the event of an operating system crash.</p><p>Reliable security is built into the i.MX 8 at every stage of design. We offer automotive grade, fail-safe reliability for solutions that are designed from the ground up specifically for optimal function in harsh operating conditions.</p><p><strong>Your idea of science fiction becomes a reality<br>\n</strong>Capabilities that you&#x2019;ve only seen in the movies will be brought to life with i.MX 8.</p><p><strong>Augmented reality (AR): </strong>The car&#x2019;s infotainment system integrates with AR and works with the windshield and gesture control. Imagine you&#x2019;re on a long road trip and a point of interest pops up as an icon on the windshield in front of you as you&#x2019;re driving, with your eyes still on the road. You could &#x2018;grab&#x2019; that icon through gesture control, as you might on a desktop computer, and &#x2018;throw&#x2019; it into a file on the other side of the windshield to save for later reference or for your passenger to investigate.</p><p><strong>Enhanced convenience: </strong>Enhanced driver accessibility and communication that goes beyond a Wi-Fi hotspot inside the car or surround view parking cameras is possible with i.MX 8 processors. Imagine your seat and steering preferences automatically adjust through the vehicle&#x2019;s facial recognition system, while it simultaneously syncs your phone and tunes the radio to your favorite station. When your mom calls, her photo pops up on the display.</p><p><strong>Device connectivity:</strong>&#xA0; Your devices that you bring into the car can connect to enhance your driving experience using i.MX 8. Your favorite applications from your mobile device will be available to you via your infotainment, cluster and heads up displays. You&#x2019;ll control them through gestures or natural language so that you can focus on driving yet safely interact with your devices.</p><p><strong>Benefit from security enhancements that meet next-gen OEM requirements<br>\n</strong>And, of course security is key.&#xA0; Automotive hacks make headlines on a daily basis, and OEMs take security of their systems extremely seriously due to the negative publicity these hacks generate.&#xA0; The i.MX 8 will integrate significant enhancements to security blocks that will meet next generation OEM requirements and provide more flexibility in the security architecture of the vehicle network<strong>&#xA0;</strong></p><p><strong>Design a single hardware platform and scale it across multiple market segments<br>\n</strong>i.MX applications processors are truly the industry&#x2019;s most&#xA0; scalable platform. You can design a single hardware platform and scale it across multiple market segments with the unique approach to pin and software compatibility within the i.MX families.</p><p>The future looks very bright for i.MX in automotive.&#xA0; Prepare yourselves for the next level of user experience in the vehicle&#x2014;it&#x2019;s going to be a great ride.</p><p><em>Ron Martino is Vice President of Applications Processors and Advanced Technology Adoption &#x2013; Microcontrollers, Freescale Semiconductor</em></p><p>&#xA0;</p>",

      "content": "<p>Did you know that vehicle registration fees often go uncollected? Frost and Sullivan estimates that, in the U.S. alone, the noncompliance rate for vehicle registration is between 5 and 10%, representing between $750 million and $1.5 billion in fees that go uncollected by states each year. The situation is worse in other places, with some countries reporting that nearly a third of all vehicles are out of compliance. That&#x2019;s a lot of uncollected tax revenue.</p><p>Fortunately, there&#x2019;s a technology that can help. NXP&#x2019;s latest generation of passive UHF RFID, called &#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/products/identification_and_security/smart_label_and_tag_ics/ucode_dna/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">UCODE DNA<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, can be used in Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI) systems that make it easier to identify &#x2013; and collect from &#x2013; drivers of vehicles that aren&#x2019;t properly registered.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/UCODE_DNA_rgb-300x164.jpg\" alt=\"UCODE_DNA_rgb\"></p><p>UCODE DNA is a breakthrough for RFID in that it combines long read range and high security. When built into a license plate, for example, UCODE DNA has a read range of about 15 m, and when built into a windshield sticker, has a read range of about 10 m. The use of crypto authentication means true security, and with NXP innovative privacy protection, there is no possibility for tracking since each wireless response from the RFID tag is unique and generated based on a new computation. So each transmission is different from the one before, and the secrets which are used as the basis for the computations are never transmitted, i.e. they are securely inserted and then kept in an electronic vault on the tag. Thus, security based on crypto authentication is protected against emulation and reverse engineering.</p><p>In an AVI system for vehicle registration, readers can be installed above, below, or to the side of the road. They can also be embedded in a handheld device, for use by government personnel. Either way, the tag, attached to the vehicle, uses the energy produced by the reader&#x2019;s RF field, so there&#x2019;s no need for a battery and the tag has a very long lifespan.</p><p>Tag readings happen in real time, at real speeds. The UCODE DNA system is fast enough to identify thousands of items in a single hour, and that means readers can be installed just about anywhere vehicles travel, including alongside freeways.</p><p>Cryptography-based security minimizes errors and practically eliminates fraud. Vehicle owners (and fee collectors) can be confident that the right person is being billed, since UCODE DNA readings are both highly accurate and highly secure. Also, because UCODE DNA tag is designed for counterfeit protection, there are fewer opportunities for theft, misuse, and false registrations.</p><p>UCODE DNA is both inexpensive and easy to deploy. In terms of installment and maintenance, it&#x2019;s far less expensive than other approaches to AVI, such as optical systems and systems that use onboard units. Also, once cars are equipped with UCODE DNA tags, the system can be extended to support other applications, and thereby maximize the investment. As examples, police forces can use the tags to issue traffic violations or locate stolen vehicles, and government-run fleets can use the tags for vehicle management.</p><p>Another advantage is that developers don&#x2019;t have to be security experts to use UCOCE DNA. NXP provides full design-in support and even offers Trust Provisioning, where crypto functions are set up and personalized during manufacturing. Also, because UCODE DNA is based on international standards, and not proprietary algorithms, designers can be confident that the technology will be interoperable and will work as specified.</p><p>Have you used an AVI system, such as automatic toll collection? What do you think might be the impact of using AVI to enforce vehicle registration?</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Related links</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/products/identification_and_security/smart_label_and_tag_ics/ucode_dna/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">NXP page for UCODE DNA<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.themobileknowledge.com/sites/default/files/Automatic%20Vehicle%20Identification.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">NXP webinar on Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI)<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p>",

      "content": "<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/zp4fmfx.jpg\" alt width=\"1404\" height=\"936\"></p><p>While service agility and increased revenue are important benefits of software-defined networking (SDN), the advantages of programming interfaces cannot be overlooked. These programming interfaces will allow SDN to turn the network into an applications platform. They will be one of SDN&#x2019;s biggest selling points, as they will enable the creation of any application imaginable to support networking needs.</p><p>Simply, SDN will offer an increased level of competitiveness to hardware vendors. Companies will compete based on how their product features are differentiated in the market to execute or support various SDN protocols such as OpenFlow etc., until one such standard emerges as the dominant one. This standardization will allow a large software community to emerge in order to write networking apps that run on any SDN equipment.</p><p>This is similar to what we saw in the PC industry, where operating systems made PCs easier to manage and support application delivery. More recently, we saw this trend in smartphones and tablets, which developed this concept even further by creating app development platforms and an apps store to simplify delivery.</p><p>SDN applications are programs that directly and programmatically communicate the network requirements and desired network behavior to the SDN controller. As SDN transitions the network from behaving autonomously using protocol-based rules into a fully programmable apps platform, SDN functions can be delivered as a service on a networking infrastructure (NaaS). Eventually, this will become a programmable platform where operators can develop and deploy more applications using the network. When the programmable interface becomes generalized and expressive, vendors could develop new, innovative ways of networking.&#xA0; This programmability offers an ecosystem to experiment, where software developers can perceive what the market wants next and introduce the idea to the network, gauging success by how many users accept it.&#xA0; The network is quickly becoming a more customizable platform that would be an asset to the businesses rather than a burden or requirement.</p><p>Think about your smartphone for a minute. It doesn&#x2019;t matter what OS you&#x2019;re running, you&#x2019;ve probably got a few apps on there. Almost everyone has an app for voice calls, text messages, email and browsing the internet. Most of us have a camera app and a maps app. But if you look at your spouse&#x2019;s phone or your sibling&#x2019;s phone or your coworker&#x2019;s phone, it&#x2019;s a pretty good bet that many of your apps are different from theirs. And just like the apps you keep on your smartphone are different than those that your friends keep, the applications you keep on your network will differ as well, though there could be many similarities. Almost everyone will have apps for firewalls and package acceleration. But you might also develop a network app specific to your business, aimed at helping you save money, get more customers and earn more revenue by increasing efficiency.</p><p>As the network slowly evolves into an applications platform, we&#x2019;ll see increased innovation applications that change the way that users interact with the network and the way operators leverage the network to benefit their business.</p><p>&#xA0;</p>",

      "content": "<p>Not long ago, as I prepared for my first trip to NXP headquarters, in Eindhoven, I got some unexpected advice: &#x201C;Take cash.&#x201D;</p><p>Like most people these days, I don&#x2019;t use a lot of cash, since debit and credit cards are accepted just about everywhere. But U.S. cards, which use a magnetic stripe and not an EMV chip for the security credentials, don&#x2019;t always work with Europe&#x2019;s EMV-based card readers, and that can spell trouble for Americans abroad.</p><p>So I exchanged dollars for euros and carried cash. It wasn&#x2019;t ideal. I fumbled with the unfamiliar bills and coins, and worried about having money on my person and in my luggage. A card would have been easier, faster, and less stressful.</p><p><strong>The shift is on</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://beheerportaal.blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/countertop_01.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-3227 size-medium\" src=\"http://beheerportaal.blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/countertop_01-300x200.jpg\" alt width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/countertop_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/countertop_01.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"></a>But times change, and I won&#x2019;t have to deal with so much cash next time. Thanks to what&#x2019;s called the &#x201C;EMV liability shift,&#x201D; America is transitioning to EMV chip-card technology, and I just received my final replacement EMV-equipped card.</p><p>The EMV liability shift is an incentive for American retailers and banks to start supporting the EMV format. As of October 2015, U.S. merchants who haven&#x2019;t adopted the EMV technology will be liable for any counterfeit fraud losses when chip cards are used. Over a two-year period, the shift will cover merchants, ATM operators, and fuel resellers. By October 2017, EMV chip cards should be the norm.</p><p><strong>Higher security = less fraud</strong></p><p>The transition to EMV cards is, for many Americans, long overdue. The total cost of fraud in the U.S., according to <a href=\"http://www.emvco.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">EMVCo<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, is estimated at $8.6 billion a year, and mag-stripe cards are part of the problem. Relying on only the cardholder&#x2019;s signature and a visual check of the card, mag-stripe cards offer minimal security.</p><p>EMV cards are a better option, since they use a secure microprocessor to protect data and maintain privacy. The data stored on an EMV chip is encrypted, so the card is harder to clone, and the chip performs cryptographic processing, during a payment, to protect privacy.</p><p><strong>What about you?</strong></p><p>Have you had problems with a mag-stripe card? Do you think EMV cards are more secure? Will you be impacted by the upcoming shift? Let us know.</p><p><strong>Join our Twitter chat on EMV</strong></p><p>In light of the October deadline, we&#x2019;re hosting a Twitter chat on the subject, using the hashtag #EMVchat with our ecosystems partners Verifone and Smart Card Alliance.

The Smart Payment Association reports that it&#x2019;s member shipped more than 1.5 billion chip enabled payment cards globally in 2014, with around 40 percent featuring contactless &#x201C;tap and go&#x201D; technology. The numbers continue to grow as countries around the world adopt chip cards with many also considering dual-interface technology to support additional applications like government identification or public transportation access.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/iPadShopper_iStock_Small.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-4516\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/iPadShopper_iStock_Small.jpg\" alt=\"iPadShopper_iStock_Small\" width=\"389\" height=\"308\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/iPadShopper_iStock_Small.jpg 389w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/iPadShopper_iStock_Small-300x238.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px\"></a>Over in Europe, there were more than 1 billion tap-and-go purchases on Visa cards in the last 12 months. And there are now 131 million Visa contactless cards in Europe, which can be used at over 2.6 million terminals, according to data from Visa. Additionally, more than 50 percent of the volumes issued in 2014 in the Government and Healthcard ID market are pure contactless or dual interface according to ABI.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s another noteworthy number: NXP&#x2019;s SmartMX2, the next-generation, dual-interface microcontroller from the SmartMX family used in many secure payment cards, identity documents and multi-application cards has reached over 1 billion shipments. NXP, with its SmartMX portfolio, now holds 47.4 percent of the payment card market and 49 percent in the secure identity market, according to ABI Research.</p><p>Contactless payment protocol, used in form factors such as credit cards, wristbands, key fobs and other devices, including smartphones, are based on secure radio-frequency identification (RFID) or near field communication (NFC). The advantage of contactless payment is that it requires no card swiping. Just wave your card over the terminal to make your payment and you&#x2019;re done. It&#x2019;s a more seamless, streamlined, user-friendly experience. Combine the SmartMX2 with a MIFARE application and users now have what we call a multi-application card &#x2013; cards that provide more functionality, for example, security payment cards in combination with public transportation, loyalty, electronic health, access or identity functionality.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Payment_3.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-4515\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Payment_3-1000x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Payment_3\" width=\"305\" height=\"312\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Payment_3-1000x1024.jpg 1000w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Payment_3-293x300.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\"></a></p><p>There are several features that make SmartMX2 the go-to choice. First is its unique integral security architecture, which provides unprecedented levels of security and performance for all types of applications. The state-of-the-art security architecture protects the integrity and confidentiality of user data and applications while delivering a comprehensive response to a wide variety of modern security attacks.</p><p>Another key feature of the SmartMX2 is the high performance and advanced attack resistance for both contact and contactless applications. This is important because, while contactless payments are growing in popularity, systems that rely on some form of contact between, for example, a payment card and the processing device are still widely used.</p><p>Since its introduction a year and half ago, the SmartMX2 has proven to be a worthy successor to the original SmartMX microcontroller platform. The SmartMX family together has reached over 5 billion unit shipments in payment as well as secure ID applications. The rapid uptake of the SmartMX2 and the speed with which it has reached more than 1 billion shipments is evidence of the fact that customers are embracing the SmartMX Technology.</p><p><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-4514\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/EMV-POS-image-cropped.jpg\" alt width=\"207\" height=\"207\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/EMV-POS-image-cropped.jpg 886w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/EMV-POS-image-cropped-150x150.jpg 150w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/EMV-POS-image-cropped-300x300.jpg 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/EMV-POS-image-cropped-320x320.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 207px) 100vw, 207px\"></p><p>Adoption for contactless payment and multi-application cards are on the rise and NXP, with its SmartMX2 microcontroller, is at the forefront of this rapid trend. Contactless cards, payment wristbands and other mobile devices equipped with multiple applications are steadily gaining traction.</p><p>The popularity of contactless payment will increase quickly in the years ahead, as the next generation of digital payments extends simplicity and convenience to mobile and wearable NFC technology.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chip.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4526\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chip.jpg\" alt=\"chip\" width=\"357\" height=\"280\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chip.jpg 720w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chip-300x235.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px\"></a></p>",

One of the recurring themes in these challenges has been ‘thermal’, and therefore he has spent much of his working life immersed in questions of a thermal nature. He has authored numerous conference papers, magazine articles and application notes on a variety of power semiconductor topics. In his free time he likes nothing better than plodding through muddy fields in the North of England.",

The detailed thermal simulation model of a typical NXP D2PAK device is shown again in Figure 1. The full description of the model can be found in my previous post, but it is worth repeating here that the dissipating part of the die model is the 1 &#xB5;m &#x2018;Die Junction&#x2019; layer. The other parts of the model are capable of conducting heat energy, but have no heat dissipation of their own.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heat1.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4506\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heat1-1024x709.jpg\" alt=\"heat1\" width=\"713\" height=\"494\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heat1-1024x709.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heat1-300x208.jpg 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heat1.jpg 1040w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px\"></a></p><p>Figure 1 An NXP D2PAK MOSFET (top left), its detailed thermal model (bottom left) and detail of the die structure (right).</p><p>Although predicting temperatures is a very important goal for thermal simulation, there are other results that may be equally useful, which simulations can provide. In particular, simulations can help us understand the <em>flow</em> of heat energy within a system over time and hence develop a better appreciation of the relative importance of the various elements within that thermal system. The graph of Figure 2 shows the vertical flow of heat energy out of the Die Junction as a function of time.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heat2.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4507\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heat2-1024x669.jpg\" alt=\"heat2\" width=\"612\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heat2-1024x669.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heat2-300x196.jpg 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heat2.jpg 1058w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\"></a></p><p>Figure 2 The vertical flow of heat energy out of the Die Junction over time.</p><p>The graph of Figure 2 suggests that, even though the aluminium layer is itself quite thin (5 &#xB5;m), a significant amount of heat energy can flow into it during short time intervals. However the long-term benefit of the aluminium is limited by the plastic material above it, which has an extremely low thermal conductivity. So as the thermal energy from the die &#x2018;charges up&#x2019; the thermal capacitance of the aluminium, the thermal gradient between the die and aluminium becomes less and so the flow of heat into the aluminium also decreases.</p><p>At this point we have a perfect opportunity to try out one of the &#x2018;what if&#x2019; analyses I mentioned in my post &#x2013; <a href=\"http://beheerportaal.blog.nxp.com/the-accidental-thermal-engineer-simulation-and-reality/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Simulation and reality<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>. Given that a thin layer of metal on the top of the die is capable of absorbing significant heat energy in the short-term, what would happen if we soldered a copper clip to the top of the die? In effect creating a &#x2018;Top-clip D2PAK&#x2019;. This would be quite difficult (though not impossible) to achieve in reality, but in simulation it is the work of mere minutes. First we create the new model, with top clip and solder, as shown in Figure 3.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heat-3.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4508\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heat-3-1024x709.jpg\" alt=\"heat 3\" width=\"728\" height=\"504\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heat-3-1024x709.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heat-3-300x208.jpg 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heat-3.jpg 1040w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\"></a></p><p>Figure 3 A detailed die model of D2PAK with top clip and solder.</p><p>Now we can run the simulations again and compare the temperature results (Figure 4) and heat flow results (Figure 5).</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heat4.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4509\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heat4-1024x670.jpg\" alt=\"heat4\" width=\"562\" height=\"368\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heat4-1024x670.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heat4-300x196.jpg 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heat4.jpg 1221w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\"></a></p><p>Figure 4 Simulated temperature results for the D2PAK with and without top clip.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heat5.png\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4510\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heat5.png\" alt=\"heat5\" width=\"564\" height=\"368\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heat5.png 977w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/heat5-300x196.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\"></a></p><p>Figure 5 The vertical flow of heat energy out of the Die Junction over time for the D2PAK with and without top clip.</p><p>Clearly the top clip has made a big difference! Figure 4 indicates a significant decrease in T<sub>J</sub> at 100 &#xB5;s and 1 ms when the top clip is present. Similarly Figure 5 demonstrates a large increase in the heat energy flowing out of the top of the die and ultimately into the top clip. In effect, the simulation indicates that we are able to influence the time-dependent thermal behaviour of the die by adding an extra heat path to the top of the die.</p><p>In my next post I will explore this theme further, taking a real device &#x2013; the <a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/products/mosfets/standard_mosfets/family/LFPAK56_MOSFETS/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">NXP LFPAK<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> &#x2013; as an example of how a top clip can be used to influence the thermal response of a power MOSFET device.</p><p>PS. We really haven&#x2019;t made any &#x2018;top clip D2PAK&#x2019; MOSFETs, nor are we planning to in the future, so I&#x2019;m afraid samples are not available. Sorry!</p>",

Cifas, a fraud prevention agency based in London, stated that more than 80% of identity theft was attempted or perpetrated online in the UK in the first three months of 2015. The number of victims has risen by 31% to 32,058 compared to 2014. Fraudsters fake identities and credit cards which are then sold online, providing a community with access to other people&#x2019;s identities.</p><p>High profile hacks over the recent years from Target to Anthem to Ashley Madison have sent personal identification information to people never intended to have this information. As customers become more aware of the growing risks, merchants and card issues recognize that protecting customers from identity fraud is a critical success factor. However, there is no single solution to successfully combat fraud but rather a series of actions that need to be taken. Battling fraud needs a combination of protective measures and risk mitigation. These measures secure card authentication, authorization and the processing system where transaction data is held.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/computer-phone-pw.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"wp-image-4502\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/computer-phone-pw-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"Hacker using laptop.

Today, the EMV standard provides the most widely adopted specification for secure chip cards and payment terminals.</p><p>The Fast Identity Online (FIDO) specification is another way to secure your personal data, by providing a new protocol for online logins. It increases security by providing access to online services without having to use a username or password while still providing security that is simple, strong, and intuitive, yet trustworthy and private. Going beyond the combination of username and password, FIDO uses either a special stand-alone security key, like a Dongle, or embedded security features of the user device itself in combination with biometrics, like a fingerprint, for authentication.<br>\nThere&#x2019;s no need for a complex username/password combination. Both systems provide an easy and seamless authentication process. It is secure while its implementation is easy and offers protection from phishing, man-in-the-middle (MITM), man-in-the-browser (MITB), and other kinds of attacks. Both schemes are already supported by a range of large service providers like Google, Paypal, Alibaba, Dropbox and others.</p><p>With these solutions in mind, what steps do you want your merchants to take to secure your identity?</p>",

NFC and BLE offer the benefits of mobile integration and an enhanced guest experience, with greater convenience and security, and also enable new services.</p><p>NFC and BLE are compatible technologies that can coexist in the same components, so implementations can be very flexible. For the time being, BLE is supported by more mobile devices, but this is changing. NFC, which is based on widespread contactless smartcard technology, is on the rise. It&#x2019;s designed for higher security and uses protocols that are form-factor independent. Also, since NFC is the predominant technology for public transport, shared mobility, and various other applications, it offers options for extending the capabilities of hotel keys.</p><p>What this adds up to, is increased use of NFC for hotel cards, driven by three things:</p><p>NFC is designed to support multiple applications in one card or device, so a single card or device can be used to open doors, make payments, earn loyalty points, rent a bike, access a rental car, access local public transportation, and more. Hotels can enhance guest experiences through more services, and can pursue cross-branding opportunities to expand their offering. Since NFC-based cards and devices can be configured multiple times, for different purposes, add-ons can be earned through rewards programs or paid subscription, and the card system itself can accommodate new features and functions over time.</p><p>NFC cards, smartphones and wearables can all be processed by infrastructure devices, such as locks, in the same way. This facilitates the co-existence of different form factors, making the integration of a loyalty card or a mobile device much simpler. Instead of dealing with multiple technologies, solution providers and hotel operators can focus on their main objective &#x2014; guest satisfaction. The wristband or smartphone app can be configured for partner services, for discounts at local restaurants, shops, museums, amusement parks, sporting venues, and other attractions. Location services can be added, too, so families and groups don&#x2019;t get lost, even in large resorts.</p><p>Because NFC is based on contactless smartcard technology, it&#x2019;s designed for scalable security. NFC cards and devices support a wide range of globally accepted countermeasures against common attacks:</p><p>Through the support of state-of-the-art cryptographic algorithms, like 3DES and AES, guests and their valuables are protected with the same high level of security that banks use to protect financial transactions.</p><p><strong>The NXP approach</strong></p><p>As the global innovation leader for secure connections, NXP supports both technologies &#x2013; NFC and BLE &#x2013; and supports secure, convenient, and cost-effective usage of both technologies. For example, our MIFARE family, which is fully compatible with NFC, offers best-in-class solutions for guest cards and loyalty cards.</p><p><strong>MIFARE options</strong></p><p><strong>Contactless infrastructure</strong></p><p>Our extensive portfolio of NFC-compliant devices enables migration to newer technologies. We support standardized, generic data structures and protocols. The products most often used in hospitality are the PN512, CLRC663, and CLRC630, as described <u>here</u>.</p><p><strong>BLE integration</strong></p><p>With the family, NXP has a competitive offering for BLE integration. Targeting applications like wearables, IoT and smart home, QN9000 devices are designed for ultra-low power consumption and high sensitivity, and use a system-on-chip (SoC) design to enable high levels of integration.</p><p><strong>Join the conversation</strong></p><p>Have you stayed in a hotel that uses NFC-based room keys? Where do you think NFC will take hotel access? And how might you use NFC to make hotel stays better?</p><p><strong>Related links</strong></p><p>Explore the world of MIFARE</p><p><a href=\"http://www.mifare.net\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">www.mifare.net<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/techzones/nfc-zone/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">NXP&#x2019;s NFC Everywhere TechZone<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/products/identification_and_security/nfc_and_reader_ics/nfc_frontend_solutions/MFRC63002HN.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">NXP high-performance MIFARE reader solution MFRC630<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/products/identification_and_security/nfc_and_reader_ics/nfc_frontend_solutions/series/PN512.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">NXP full NFC Forum-compliant solution PN512<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.smartcardalliance.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Smartcard Alliance<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/techzones/nfc-zone/overview.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">www.nxp.com/techzones/nfc-zone/overview.html<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p>",

This makes sense because there is a strong association between SDN and cloud data centers, given that the SDN technology was initially adopted and subsequently evolved from these data centers. SDN was the secret sauce that allowed data centers to be more profitable and agile. Therefore, SDN wasn&#x2019;t something that these data centers wanted to broadly share with the rest of the world. This hindered development of SDN and made it difficult for other types of companies to see the value of SDN.</p><p>It has only been within the last two years that SDN technologies have been let out of the solitary confinement of data centers. Open communities such as ETSI-NFV and OPNFV are starting to apply this basic idea of centralized programmability to WAN, Metro and CPE equipment and alternate transports.</p><p>As carriers began to take notice, they realized that by using SDN, operators were able to efficiently deliver high quality services to a large end user community without ripping up their hardware on a regular basis. By implementing a virtualized platform, carriers were able to increase network speed and agility, hence enhancing service delivery. This infrastructure update also enabled carriers to address latency constraints and increased ability to solve problems in real-time. These improvements have made their way into the basic fabric of SDN.</p><p>Further, carrier networks have extended beyond their own walls to encompass end users.&#xA0; They have extended these SDN/NFV concepts from the WAN to customer on-premise devices. For example, Google rolled out its own next-generation data centers, incorporating SDN and NFV into them. But they also spread these concepts to the general public, providing new services, faster speeds and better user experience.</p><p>SDN has expanded outside the data centers to end users and has offered countless opportunities for other markets. However there has been some hesitation from enterprises, since adopting SDN means a new area to manage, new responsibilities and a whole new set of programming rules to learn. As a respite, new applications are beginning to emerge that will make the value proposition much stronger for the enterprises. For example, hybrid data centers allow enterprises to farm out services from an enterprise&#x2019;s private data center to a public one and back. With SDN implemented, it becomes very easy to move that data and workloads around to the place best-suited to execute them.</p><p>But why stop at just enterprise adoption? How about applying SDN techniques to industrial, commercial and the various markets served by distributors? Due to its flexibility, SDN offers countless opportunities for all these markets. Once its reins come off and the industry becomes increasingly aware of its advantages, the possibilities are endless!</p>",

      "content": "<p>It&#x2019;s an exciting time for mobile payments, with wearable technology now honing the industry&#x2019;s cutting edge.</p><p>As on the fashion runways, almost anything goes. There are payment wristbands and payment watches. There&#x2019;s a ring that uses Bitcoins to make a payment. A British fashion designer is integrating near field communication technology into his new clothing line. Also in England, Barclays Bank has announced that its customers will soon be able to make payments using a Barclays wristband or key fob&#x2014;or even a sticker that turns any flat surface into a paypoint.</p><p>Mobile payment is quickly becoming standard in leading smartphones. Apple was first to market with Apple Pay, a mobile payment service that enables certain Apple devices, including the iPhone 6 and the Apple Watch, make payments at contactless points of sale. Google has now launched Android Pay, another tap-and-go system that allows consumers to simply hold their Android phone or other compatible device near a merchant&#x2019;s contactless terminal and instantly complete a transaction.</p><p>The exercise-focused fitness band Jawbone is also getting in on the action with its new built-in payments technology powered by Amex.</p><p>One of the most intriguing new payment devices comes from a Canadian-based startup called Nymi. The company has developed a wearable device called the Nymi Band that reads your electrocardiogram to verify identification. Because your heart beat is unique, just like your fingerprint, the wristband can authenticate your identity whenever you have it on and purchases can be made securely using it.</p><p>&#x201C;In enterprise, where security matters, multifactor authentication is a requirement, and all the tools, to be honest, suck,&#x201D; said Karl Martin, Nymi&#x2019;s CEO and co-founder. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re in this position where the market is really ripe for multifactor authentication applications that work across physical and logical access. It&#x2019;s our primary area of focus today.&#x201D;</p><p>Nymi has partnered with MasterCard and Royal Bank of Canada for a pilot trial starting this summer&#x2014;and NXP is providing the technology to make it happen. This new easy and secure method of payment pairs the innovative biometric security of the Nymi Band with industry-leading payment chips from NXP.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/wristband.png\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4476 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/wristband-300x169.png\" alt=\"wristband\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/wristband-300x169.png 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/wristband-1024x577.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"></a></p><p>In fact, NXP powers many of the next-generation payment systems on the market. With our SmartMX portfolio of microcontrollers, NXP now holds 47.4 percent of the payment card market, according to ABI Research.</p><p>The synergy between wearables and mobile payments is strong. Nearly 40 percent of people who are highly likely to buy wearables in the coming year say they want it to come with mobile wallet functionality, according to a new study from market research and consulting firm Chadwick Martin Bailey. Additionally, 64 percent of shoppers say they would be willing to make purchases with a wearable if they have one, found a new study by e-commerce provider Avangate.</p><p>Overall, wearable device adoption is expected to accelerate markedly in the next few years. Juniper Research predicts global wearable device shipments will increase more than 400 percent by 2017, reaching 116 million units, up from 27 million in 2014.</p><p>Of course, as is the case with anything that people wear, there will not be a one-size-fits-all solution in the field of payment wearables. That&#x2019;s OK. Here at NXP, we&#x2019;re open minded. And we&#x2019;re excited to build the chips that will bring mobile payments to the masses&#x2014;in all their many fashionable forms.</p><p>&#xA0;</p>",

One of the recurring themes in these challenges has been ‘thermal’, and therefore he has spent much of his working life immersed in questions of a thermal nature. He has authored numerous conference papers, magazine articles and application notes on a variety of power semiconductor topics. In his free time he likes nothing better than plodding through muddy fields in the North of England.",

      "content": "<p>Most power semiconductor devices are constructed in a very similar way. The active part of the device, or &#x2018;die&#x2019;, is soldered to some form of copper tab or leadframe. Pins or legs are added to make connections to the PCB and the whole thing is either partially or completely encapsulated in plastic. Alternatively for most surface-mount devices, the outer surface of the tab is exposed so that the device may be soldered to a PCB, with the tab also providing the thermal and electrical pathway from the die to the outside world. This is the method of construction employed in D2PAK and DPAK devices for instance, which you may be familiar with.</p><p>The thermal simulation model of a typical NXP D2PAK device is shown in Fig. 1. This is an example of a &#x2018;detailed&#x2019; thermal model which, as the name suggests, includes discretely modelled elements such as the die, legs and tab.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/fig1.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4458\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/fig1-1024x709.jpg\" alt=\"fig1\" width=\"1024\" height=\"709\"></a></p><p>Fig. 1 An NXP D2PAK MOSFET (top left), its detailed thermal model (bottom left) and detail of the die structure (right)</p><p>For an NXP power MOSFET the die model is more refined than just a simple slab of silicon with uniform power dissipation. As you can see from Fig.1, the die has an overall thickness of 240 &#xB5;m. This is split into two parts: the Die Body, which is thermally conductive but non-dissipative, and the thinner Die Junction which is thermally conductive and the source of the die dissipation when the device is conducting current. And on top of the die we have a 5 &#xB5;m layer of aluminium. This level of die detail is essential when carrying out device transient thermal analyses.</p><p>Because of the non-uniform nature of the die, it is not immediately obvious how the heat energy will flow through the device when the Die Junction is dissipating or how the temperature in the various parts of the device will rise over time. Using simulations, we can model these effects very easily, as I will now demonstrate.</p><p>For the purposes of this exercise we will use a simulation model of a D2PAK MOSFET mounted on a PCB. Using the detailed device model shown in Fig. 1 we will run several transient thermal simulations of different durations and observe the temperature rise and heat flow in the die. Starting temperature is 20 &#xB0;C in all cases and the simulation durations (or power pulse widths) will be 1 &#xB5;s, 10 &#xB5;s, 100 &#xB5;s and 1 ms. In all cases power dissipation in the Die Junction is 1500 W and junction temperature T<sub>J</sub> is recorded at the centre of the Die Junction. Temperature plots from the simulation are shown in Fig. 2. To aid clarity I have taken a slice through the centre of the model, hidden the plastic and the legs, and made the tab transparent in three cases. I have done this to make the development of temperature within the device die more clearly visible.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/fig2.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4459\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/fig2-1024x709.jpg\" alt=\"fig2\" width=\"1024\" height=\"709\"></a></p><p>Fig. 2 Temperature plots for the D2PAK MOSFET after 1 &#xB5;s, 10 &#xB5;s, 100 &#xB5;s and 1 ms.</p><p>Some interesting observations:</p><p>If we were to look at the heat flow through the various parts of the structure we would find that, after 1ms, less than 1% of the total heat energy is leaving the device through the bottom of the tab, and even less than that through the plastic surrounding the device. This leads us to perhaps the most interesting and useful conclusion of all.</p><p>Additional exercises carried out for other power packages (DPAK, TO220, LFPAK, etc.) have resulted in similar conclusions.</p><p>In the next post I&#x2019;ll look at how we can modify the temperature development within the device using a top clip to provide thermal advantages under certain conditions.</p>",

We have had several training sessions on the on the topic of <a href=\"http://nxp.com/sensordata\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">sensor data analytics <span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>that roughly paralleled this blog series (see references at the end of this article).&#xA0; We also spent a lot of time at our Technology Forum on the Tech Lab floor running demos, one of which is shown in the video below.&#xA0; I like this one because it&#x2019;s a great example of some of the techniques outlined in the earlier posts of this series.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Pump data collected at&#xA0;our Technology Forum</p><p>I took a lot of data on this setup, in a number of different environments leading up to&#xA0;our Technology Forum.&#xA0; I&#x2019;ve seen these clusters move around.&#xA0; Sometimes the &#x201C;empty&#x201D; and &#x201C;blocked&#x201D; clusters are difficult to distinguish.&#xA0;&#xA0; So for the purposes of machine learning, I merged them into one common &#x201C;error class&#x201D;.&#xA0; I then computed a support vector machine based on those collapsed sets.</p><p>SVM hyperplanes and support vectors</p><p>The figure above shows&#xA0;computed SVM hyperplanes, as well as the support vectors (highlighted samples) used to compute them.&#xA0; The figure below shows the in-sample errors of that SVM.&#xA0; Click on any of the three figures to see an expanded view.</p><p>In-sample errors for the computed model</p><p>Once the SVM was computed in Matlab&#xAE;, we exported the model as a C-language function which was then inserted into a 2nd embedded program designed to run on the same board used for the initial data logging.&#xA0; We added a small &#x201C;debounce&#x201D; function to add some stability in the transition regions, and then used the output of that to control the colors of the LED on the board.&#xA0; We also interfaced with a second board which offered wireless access to a <a href=\"http://threadgroup.org/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Thread-based network<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> for home automation.&#xA0; Every time the pump changed state, events were sent out to various displays scattered around the Technology Forum&#xA0;flow.&#xA0; Way cool!</p><p>At the end of <a title=\"Mining sensor data, Part 4\" href=\"/sensors/mining-sensor-data-part-4/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Part 4 of this series</a>, I listed a bunch of warnings/lessons learned.&#xA0; I saw many of those manifest themselves in this experiment as well.&#xA0; For instance, our first pump was broken during shipment from Phoenix to Austin for our&#xA0;Technology Forum.&#xA0; So we had to swap in the backup pump before the event.&#xA0; Over the course of three days at our event, we could tell that the data clusters moved as the new pump got &#x201C;broken in&#x201D;.&#xA0; I think this is normal and to be expected.&#xA0; It&#xA0;again highlights the need to collect enough data to guarantee that your &#x201C;in-sample&#x201D; probability distributions&#xA0;are a reasonable approximation of your infinitely large&#xA0;&#x201C;out-of-sample&#x201D; distributions.</p><p>This particular demo got a lot of interest from attendees, and I want to personally thank those who visited the booth and then took up my invitation to join an afternoon class on the topic.&#xA0; Most of those who attended then stayed an extra 30 minutes past the formal end of the course to ask questions and get a peek at our Matlab code.&#xA0; We only wrapped up when we got booted out of the room for the next class!&#xA0; The whole event reinforced my belief that we are seeing the birth of a new trend which utilizes sensor data analytics to create new applications and create new value propositions for old ones.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Music festivals and other kinds of outdoor concerts are big business. There are more than 3,000 music festivals each year in Europe alone, and the live music industry for the E.U. and the U.S. is estimated to be worth at least $46 billion. Tickets are the biggest revenue generator, but onsite sales of beverages, food, and merchandise, are also a significant source of revenue.</p><p>Festival goers represent, by some estimates, about 80 million loyal fans in North American and Europe. The audience is, by and large, teenagers and twenty-somethings, but a number of pre-teens and even young children also attend, accompanied by their parents. All in all, it&#x2019;s a significant market, covering a broad-section of young-minded, tech-savvy people who enjoy large-scale social experiences.</p><p>Putting on an event that welcomes thousands of people is a big job. Attendees want an enjoyable, interactive experience, without having to wait in lines, and festival managers need to manage staffing to ensure everything goes smoothly. Also, using cash at the venue can be an issue for festival-goers and managers alike. Carrying cash can be risky, given pickpockets and other thieves, and it can be frustrating to run out if there aren&#x2019;t any cash machines near the event or onsite. Accepting cash can be costly, too, since employees can skim profits, and there can be fees associated with transporting, depositing, and insuring cash transactions. Overall, the true cost of supporting cash can be as high as 15%.</p><p>To streamline operations, reduce costs, and provide a better audience experience, more and more events are doing away with cash, and even eliminating paper tickets. They key ingredient is MIFARE, the contactless proximity technology found in public transport, electronic IDs, payment cards, and more.</p><p>MIFARE comes in a range of form factors, from wristbands and key fobs to stickers and photo IDs, or as part of an app on a smartphone. Used at several points throughout the event, MIFARE can make music festivals and other large-scale venues more fun for the audience, and more cost-effective for the organizer.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4432 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/NXP-cashless-300x199.png\" alt=\"NXP cashless\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/NXP-cashless-300x199.png 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/NXP-cashless.png 878w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"></p><p><strong>MIFARE provides a long list of benefits</strong><br>\n<strong> to attendees and event managers alike</strong></p><p>As more event organizers begin using MIFARE at their venues, and more audience members experience the benefits of MIFARE, the concept of ticketless, cashless events is gaining momentum. The idea is catching on at music festivals, but at other large-scale events, too, such as sporting events, amusement parks, and just about anywhere large groups of people gather together to have fun and share experiences.</p><p>Football, soccer fans support their team and celebrate goal, score, victory.

At NXP&#x2019;s Digital Identity Forum a panel of inspiring experts discussed what it takes to turn data collection from a perceived threat into an opportunity to increase our wellbeing.</strong></p><p>&#x201C;Do you have any data regrets?&#x201D; was the first thing moderator and TV journalist&#xA0;<a href=\"http://mobileworldcongress.nxp.com/2015/speaker/ben-fajzullin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Ben Fajzullin<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>&#xA0;asked the audience at NXP&#x2019;s Forum on&#xA0;<a href=\"http://mobileworldcongress.nxp.com/2015/about/digital-identity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Digital Identity<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>&#xA0;at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. He earned lots of smiles and affirmative nods. Haven&#x2019;t we all downloaded an app or agreed to Terms of Use when we hadn&#x2019;t read them or weren&#x2019;t quite sure what they were all about? Author and panelist&#xA0;<a href=\"http://mobileworldcongress.nxp.com/2015/speaker/john-c-havens/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">John C. Havens<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>&#xA0;illustrated this point by highlighting an experiment carried out in London. The company who lead the experiment inserted a clause into it&#x2019;s T&amp;Cs stipulating those who signed up for its free WiFi agreed to give away their first born child &#x2013; and people still signed up! Obviously, they just did not read what they had clicked on.</p><p>We live in a time where more and more data is being collected about us via apps, devices, companies, and governments, creating a digital identity. However, collecting data does not have to be a bad thing. The central question is who has access to and control over our information. At the NXP Forum, the panelist agreed that it is up to companies as well as consumers to make a positive shift happen.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnchavens/status/572385382664425474/photo/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><img class=\" wp-image-4416 size-medium aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CCpVsXzW0AAex4e-300x298.png\" alt=\"CCpVsXzW0AAex4e\" width=\"300\" height=\"298\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CCpVsXzW0AAex4e-300x298.png 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CCpVsXzW0AAex4e-150x150.png 150w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CCpVsXzW0AAex4e.png 589w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"></a></p><p>German journalist&#xA0;<a href=\"http://mobileworldcongress.nxp.com/2015/speaker/steffan-heuer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Steffan Heuer<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>&#xA0;opened the Forum with a keynote focusing on the responsibility of each individual. &#x201C;We have to use common sense and think before downloading an app or posting anything online,&#x201D; Heuer said. &#x201C;Once out there, we can&#x2019;t take it back easily.&#x201D; Every one of us, he argued, should spend more time and effort to defend our digital selves.</p><p>Jeff Miles, Vice President of Mobile Transactions at NXP, pointed out that consumers should start asking tougher questions about what happens with their data. &#x201C;Everyone should know exactly who their information is going to.&#x201D; He sees that as responsibility of the industry, too: &#x201C;Tech companies have an obligation to assist the consumer. We should simplify things like terms of use so they&#x2019;re easy to understand and quick to read.&#x201D;</p><p><iframe title=\"Thought leaders give their opinions on digital identity and how to protect it\" width=\"1220\" height=\"686\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6uWfZRRxof0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Transparency was the key word during the discussion. The panel agreed that it is an essential prerequisite for people to actually profit from the collection of their personal data. &#x201C;Companies should provide transparency about what they do with our data,&#x201D; author and content strategist&#xA0;<a href=\"http://mobileworldcongress.nxp.com/2015/speaker/kitty-ireland/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Kitty Ireland<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>&#xA0;said. &#x201C;Data has monetary value but it also is the story of our life. It belongs to us, so we should have access to it.&#x201D;</p><p>Author John C. Havens elaborated on this aspect in the second keynote of the Forum. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not about privacy, it&#x2019;s about control,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We should be able decide what data we want to share.&#x201D; Companies, he argued, will in the long run profit only if they involve the people they are tracking. Havens sees a control shift underway. &#x201C;Once we get the framework of data control set, we will be able to take advantage of the data collected.&#x201D;</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NXP_Auto/status/572415949745356801/photo/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4414 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CCpVsXzW0AAex4e-1-232x300.png\" alt=\"CCpVsXzW0AAex4e (1)\" width=\"232\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CCpVsXzW0AAex4e-1-232x300.png 232w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CCpVsXzW0AAex4e-1.png 574w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mathewsmithfr/status/572410537310605312/photo/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><img class=\" wp-image-4415 size-medium aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CCpVsXzW0AAex4e-2-300x300.png\" alt=\"CCpVsXzW0AAex4e (2)\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CCpVsXzW0AAex4e-2-300x300.png 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CCpVsXzW0AAex4e-2-150x150.png 150w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CCpVsXzW0AAex4e-2-320x320.png 320w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/CCpVsXzW0AAex4e-2.png 578w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"></a></p><p>As Kitty Ireland pointed out, too: If used wisely, data can help to improve the human condition as it is an unprecedented repository of knowledge about human behavior. It could even improve urban planning, discover health and well-being trends within populations and thus help provide individually targeted care and education.</p><p>In the end, the panel agreed that companies have to involve consumers as partners and stop tracking and collecting data without their knowledge. &#x201C;The goal of innovation should be to increase our wellbeing instead of increasing profit&#x201D;, John C. Havens said. NXP&#x2019;s Jeff Miles agreed and ended in an optimistic note: &#x201C;Tech companies will innovate on behalf of consumers,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We should not be afraid of tech.&#x201D;</p>",

      "content": "<p>As embedded developers strive to increase the functionality of consumer devices, energy consumption must be optimized in every aspect of their designs. This includes the boot (or start up) of the MCU. For MCUs in the Kinetis L series and K series, there are several capabilities built into the chip design that reduce energy using clocking configuration, default states of I/O pins and control of boot clocking so the developer can design around power source constraints. Before any line of application code is executed, the Kinetis MCU design has pre-built energy saving capabilities that reduce the time and power consumed during boot.</p><p><em>Here is the challenge.</em> At the time of powering up and booting a microcontroller, many circuits on the application board are powered at once. This can cause a large in-rush current in the components of the PCB such as de-coupling capacitors. There is a certain amount of energy that is needed to boot up the microcontroller, the application current, and that energy has to be provided somehow. Also, lots of MCU functions need to be initialized and this involves movement of data. Hence, it usually leads to a significant start-up current for the MCU.</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/EnergyEfficientStart.png\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12533\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/EnergyEfficientStart.png\" alt=\"EnergyEfficientStart\" width=\"626\" height=\"412\"></a></p><p>But, some applications and some customers require current consumption to be very low (&lt;1mA) at the time of booting and even while the application is running. The maximum current that the power supply can source could be limited.</p><p>The&#xA0;Kinetis K series MCUs, along with system design, can help you&#xA0;solve this problem.</p><p>One critical component is a current limiting device. This will ensure that the current limitation is never exceeded. In addition, in order to ensure there is enough energy to boot up the micro, decoupling caps have to be sized to provide the right amount of energy storage. The great thing about a low power Kinetis device is that this decoupling cap can be optimized for size and cost to match user&#x2019;s low power capabilities.</p><p>Now, several others features have to be used on the Kinetis device like its configurable reset for low voltage and its very low power run mode. When boot up first occurs, a software routine can be used to raise the trip point to the highest level. This ensures the MCU is placed in reset during the charge up process of the external de-coupling capacitors. After the charging of the capacitors, the trip point is adjusted to a lower level for fast discharging of the capacitors. Hence, this would reduce the in-rush current to a great extent. (Watch this <a href=\"http://www.freescale.com/webapp/video_vault/videoSummary.sp?code=KINETIS-LOW-POWER-BOOT-VID\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">video<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> for scope plots of the power-up sequence and more.)</p><p>The methods in the video show how working with a very limited power supply is possible with low power Kinetis MCUs using various features together. Other capabilities that reduce energy consumption for startup include default pin configurations and status registers that indicate the cause of the last chip reset. Supporting an energy efficient start will allow embedded technology to propagate into new and innovative places in the internet of tomorrow.</p><p>&#xA0;</p>",

The festival coincides with the Four- Day Marches in Nijmegen, which is the largest multiple day walking event in the world with 45,000 participants. During the Four-Day Marches numerous activities are organized in the town center as part of the &#x2018;Vierdaagsefeesten&#x2019;, including performances by various artists. The Marches and the &#x2018;Vierdaagsefeesten&#x2019; collectively attract over 2.35 million visitors to the city each year, which makes it the perfect place for NXP to apply its &#x2018;contactless&#x2019; chip technology.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/FOW6774.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4385\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/FOW6774-1024x665.jpg\" alt=\"_FOW6774\" width=\"1024\" height=\"665\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/FOW6774-1024x665.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/FOW6774-300x195.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></p><p>All bars and restaurants involved in the Valkhof Festival, Valkhof Park, Plein 1944, Hennis Latin Stage and caf&#xE9; van Ouds are (partly) going to switch from the traditional tokens that visitors were able to use to pay for their food and drinks to a chip card enabling &#x2018;cashless&#x2019; payments. It is expected that this new way of paying is really going to take off and that soon visitors to the city center and the festival will be able to pay for their food and drinks with the same card.</p><p>The chips that NXP has developed to enable contactless communication are part of the MIFARE-family. The first generation of chips was launched onto the market around 20 years ago. Nowadays the term MIFARE covers a whole range of chips: from simple chips without security to very advanced chips with a very high degree of security. The chip that can be used at the festivity locations to make &#x2018;cashless&#x2019; payments is a MIFARE chip (type DESFire) that uses the NFC technology. This is a very secure chip that was developed at the beginning of this century and enables visitors to make secure payments. Today the MIFARE DESFire chip is not only used in cards but is also increasingly being used in Smartphones. Expectations are that consumers will be able to pay using their Smartphone with DESFire chip in the near future.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/FOW6816.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4383\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/FOW6816-1024x665.jpg\" alt=\"_FOW6816\" width=\"1024\" height=\"665\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/FOW6816-1024x665.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/FOW6816-300x195.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></p><p>The banks are also making great progress with the introduction and promotion of NFC. There will be a huge noncontact terminal in the Molenstraat. Visitors of the Four-Day festivities who make a contactless payment in one of the participating shops will earn a coupon that could win them great prizes, such as a tablet, smart watch, or mobile telephone. To make all this possible, several shops in Nijmegen are having noncontact terminals installed in time for the Four-Day week. In addition, visitors can use their bank cards to make contactless payments in a number of cafes and bars on the Faberplein.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/FOW6818.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4384\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/FOW6818-1024x665.jpg\" alt=\"_FOW6818\" width=\"1024\" height=\"665\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/FOW6818-1024x665.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/FOW6818-300x195.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></p><p>For NXP this is a good example of innovation in practice, in our own city, and during the largest walking event in the Netherlands.</p><p>&#xA0;</p>",

One of the recurring themes in these challenges has been ‘thermal’, and therefore he has spent much of his working life immersed in questions of a thermal nature. He has authored numerous conference papers, magazine articles and application notes on a variety of power semiconductor topics. In his free time he likes nothing better than plodding through muddy fields in the North of England.",

      "content": "<p>A large part of thermal analysis work is concerned with carrying out &#x2018;what if?&#x2019; analyses. For example, if I have a PCB with dissipating components on it I would probably like to know what temperatures those components will run at. But <em>what if</em> I add more components? <em>What if</em> I mount them closer together? <em>What if</em> I add a cooling fan? What difference does any of this make?</p><p>Similarly, <a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/products/mosfets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">as a MOSFET manufacturer<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, we might sometimes want to know the thermal consequences of varying a package design or changing the types of materials used in the package and so on.</p><p>Of course, it is possible to answer these questions by building and testing actual prototypes, and at some stage in the design process we will have to do this anyway. But in the early stages of a design or feasibility study it makes much more sense to carry out the investigations using simulation software, where changes to a configuration can be made easily and analysis of results viewed quickly. The thermal simulation package that we use for this purpose is Mentor Graphics&#x2019; FloTHERM&#xAE; (other simulation packages are available), which allows thermal models to be built and simulated in a 3D CAD-style environment.</p><p>An obvious question at this point is: do we trust the simulations to give us reasonably accurate answers? I would say &#x2018;yes&#x2019; for two reasons:</p><p>So, assuming we use the software properly, we should be fairly confident of the results. Even so, from time to time it&#x2019;s still good to carry out some calibration or &#x2018;sanity check&#x2019; exercises, and it&#x2019;s an example of one such exercise that I&#x2019;d like to share in this post.</p><h3>A real-life example</h3><p>For this exercise, identical MOSFET devices were mounted on PCBs of the same overall size but with varying amounts of copper coverage. See Fig. 1 and Table 1.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Mosfetnew.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4376\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Mosfetnew.jpg\" alt=\"Mosfetnew\" width=\"527\" height=\"331\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Mosfetnew.jpg 527w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Mosfetnew-300x188.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px\"></a></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/board.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4377\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/board.jpg\" alt=\"board\" width=\"608\" height=\"663\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/board.jpg 608w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/board-275x300.jpg 275w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px\"></a></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/board2.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4378\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/board2.jpg\" alt=\"board2\" width=\"551\" height=\"414\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/board2.jpg 551w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/board2-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 551px) 100vw, 551px\"></a></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>For each PCB configuration the MOSFET device was powered with a constant 1 W and allowed to reach a steady-state temperature. Each MOSFET had a calibrated on-die temperature sensor which allowed us to take extremely accurate measurements of junction temperature (T<sub>J</sub>) in the steady state. The ambient temperature during each test was also recorded. The four PCBs were then recreated in simulation, with die dissipation set to 1 W, and the steady-state temperatures recorded. The real and simulated results are recorded in Table 2, expressed as <a href=\"http://www.coolingzone.com/library.php?read=485\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">thermal resistances<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> as described in the JESD51 series of <a href=\"http://www.jedec.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">JEDEC standards<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/table.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4379\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/table.jpg\" alt=\"table\" width=\"535\" height=\"232\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/table.jpg 535w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/table-300x130.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px\"></a></p><p>&#xA0;</p><h3>So how did we do?</h3><p>Well, the A, B and C boards came very close to the measured result, but G still needs a little work. We must remember that not all the simulation input parameters can be known with absolute certainty &#x2013; this being particularly true of material thermo-physical properties.</p><p>It is also worth remembering that our measurement of reality may not be perfect: all real-life test equipment has some degree of error associated with its measurements. There isn&#x2019;t enough space in this post to explore these potential errors in detail, but it could certainly be the subject of a future blog post!</p><p>Next time: how simulation can help us look at what goes on in a device die at very short timescales.</p><p>&#xA0;</p>",

The program aims to make a huge impact in 2015 with the BBC and its partners committed providing up to 1 million micro:bits, given freely to every child in year 7 or equivalent across the UK.</p><p>The relevance of the project, and the excitement around it since it has been launched has been so high, that partners have soon been asked:</p><p><strong>Is this just a 2015 initiative?&#xA0;</strong><strong>Will others be able to buy a micro:bit?</strong></p><p>The partnership announced on July 7 plans to collectively develop a not-for-profit company to oversee and drive the micro:bit legacy. Not only siblings and children in other year groups in UK, but also children and technology passionates in other countries may also want to own their own micro:bit. The partners will be giving them the chance to join in the coding revolution.</p><p>Starting this Fall, micro:bits will be available for retail pre-order in the UK, and internationally through the program partners. These devices will be distributed toward end of this year, as soon as the last free micro:bits arrive in the hands of year 7 or equivalent children. The revenue generated will enable the creation, and ongoing support, of a longer term charitable legacy for the micro:bit partnership.</p><p>Exact pricing and availability will be confirmed soon.</p><p>One of the core aims of the micro:bit project was to help stimulate the market for low entry coding devices.&#xA0;The device&#xA0;will be&#xA0;open source, allowing others to create, manufacture and vary the capability of their own devices without restriction. This will also help stimulate the micro:bit ecosystem, giving partners and other companies the chance to create accessories and new tools for the micro:bit.</p><p>We live in a technology driven world, where nearly every aspect of our lives can be made safer and more productive through modern electronics. To ensure we don&#x2019;t have a shortage of engineering talent and expertise, we must encourage more students to study STEM fields that will drive tomorrow&#x2019;s economy. To answer these challenges, Freescale has established the Freescale Foundation in 2013, to support initiatives that helps instill students, at the earliest age possible, with the belief that they can be a catalyst for innovation.</p><p>We believe, with our micro:bit project&#x2019;s partners, that this newly announced initiative, carrying the micro:bit legacy forward, will help stimulate children interest in STEM internationally and develop the next generation of innovators.</p><p><strong><em>Contributed by Freescale Staff</em></strong></p>",

By privacy I mean the transparent, responsible and technically savvy stewardship of our digital identities. Trade publications surveying the slew of hardware and software announcements drew the same conclusion: &#x201C;GSMA&#x2019;S Mobile World Congress Becomes&#xA0;<a title=\"Associations Now\" href=\"http://associationsnow.com/2015/03/gsmas-mobile-world-congress-becomes-ground-zero-privacy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Ground Zero for Privacy<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>&#x201D;.</p><p>It&#x2019;s an area where the mistrust and wariness of consumers and citizens remain largely unanswered by most companies. As a semiconductor maker deeply embedded in the emerging &#x201C;smarter world,&#x201D; NXP organized a <a title=\"Me &amp; My Smarter World\" href=\"http://mobileworldcongress.nxp.com/2015/about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">series of panels<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> about digital identity and individual privacy, signaling its intention to stake a claim as a responsible steward of small and big data.</p><p>Yet, a lot more remains to be done. Most companies still conflate or confuse information security with data privacy. An organization may store millions of digital identities &#x2013; my actions, transactions, preferences or failings &#x2013; safely on their servers or transmit them in a secure fashion. No doubt, info-sec is a key part of a well-functioning connected world, with&#xA0;<a title=\"Forrester\" href=\"http://blogs.forrester.com/stephanie_balaouras/14-11-12-more_money_more_problems_for_security_organizations_in_2015\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Forrester pointing out<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> right after MWC that 60% of all companies will experience a data breach this year.</p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn&#x2019;t follow from defending against hackers that a company will come clean on how they use our bits and with whom they trade or share them &#x2013;government entities at the backdoor included. Data may be &#x201C;secured&#x201D; when it comes to the services powering my smart home or my electric car, but that&#x2019;s no substitute for a transparent and clearly written explanation of how a company will make use of it. Terms of service are notoriously opaque, vague or subject to change for business or legal reasons. What we are still struggling with when it comes to web services and mobile apps will only become worse with the mass adoption of wearables to instrument our bodies and instrumenting the rest of the world&#x2019;s objects, better known as the Internet of Things.</p><p>A &#x201C;New Deal for Big Data,&#x201D; as several speakers at the NXP booth in Barcelona suggested, makes a lot of sense. But fleshing out the details will be difficult because of a huge information imbalance between companies and individuals (let&#x2019;s not degrade them to mere &#x201C;consumers&#x201D; or &#x201C;users&#x201D;).</p><p>The Internet&#x2019;s business model is built around surveillance, even if you want to call it a benign one, and the operating system or algorithms powering it over time have taken on a life of their own. They allow for subtle, but constant nudging, forcing, manipulation or even discrimination. Small wonder that world-class privacy <a title=\"Ethics of Algorithms\" href=\"https://cihr.eu/the-ethics-of-algorithms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">experts recently gathered in Berlin<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> to discuss the &#x201C;ethics of algorithms&#x201D; &#x2013; or rather lament their absence. (For the most comprehensive and insightful exploration into the algorithm quandary that seemingly neutral technology creates, read <a title=\"Essay\" href=\"http://www.iasc-culture.org/THR/THR_article_2015_Spring_Pasquale.php%20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Frank Pasquale&#x2019;s recent essay<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>.)</p><p>The bottom line is this: For individuals, today&#x2019;s dominant systems like Google&#x2019;s search algorithms are black boxes, shielded as valuable commercial secrets, and it looks as if the same will happen with sensor-studded watches and sentient objects in our homes and cars.</p><p>Any company in the emerging &#x201C;smart world&#x201D; arena that takes the stewardship of our digital identities seriously must clearly lay out its governing principles and practices when it comes to handling data, not just talk about encryption or server security. It also should give individuals a real say in the discussion and evolution of those practices instead of burying us with reams of vague and meaningless legalese.</p><p>There is a moral and monetary case to be made for an individual to entrust his or her data to a commercial entity in the future. It&#x2019;s not the outdated and dishonest &#x201C;free&#x201D; model, but a transactional relationship that&#x2019;s more at eye level. It should give us all more control over who knows what about us when and in what context. Companies from the &#x201C;old economy,&#x201D; by the way, rank much higher in terms of trust than the new entrants. The most <a title=\"Data Monitor\" href=\"http://www.sas.com/de_de/whitepapers/ba-st-forsa-der-umgang-mit-daten-2343928.html%20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">recent Data Monitor report<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> by pollster Forsa is a good case in point. While Germans have the highest confidence in medical doctors, financial service providers and retailers, they barely trust telcos and Internet service providers. Nevertheless, one in five would still sell his or her data &#x2014; to a company that can be trusted.</p><p>It&#x2019;s up to each business to prove that all the talk at MWC about putting privacy first amounts to something.</p>",

Designed for the road, the one of a kind car demonstrates the latest in connected technology as well as an innovative, completely unique, modular design.</p><p>The project is the result of close collaboration between students at the university and NXP Semiconductors. The students built the car using NXP chip technology and relied on experienced NXP automotive engineers to advise them along the way.</p><p>&#x201C;At NXP we try and build the components that make the world smarter,&#x201D; said Han Raaijmakers, System architect, NXP. &#x201C;We see [the Nova car] as a demo vehicle, we put new electronics inside the car to make it not just a new car for the students but a new car for everyone.&#x201D;</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_2003.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4330\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_2003-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_2003\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_2003-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_2003-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\"></a></p><p>The result is a concept car that offers a glimpse into future of mobility. The vehicle contains Vehicle-to-Vehicle/Infrastructure (V2X) technology so it can &#x2018;talk&#x2019; to other vehicles and other connected infrastructure &#x2013; a core feature of the future smarter world. It also contains a whole host of other secure NXP technology which underpins its capabilities.</p><p>The car&#x2019;s modular design means that almost every part of the vehicle can be easily taken off and replaced with another module, allowing the car to be fully customisable. It is also very energy efficient and green as it is totally powered by electricity.</p><p>&#x201C;We actually built a car, not many people can say that,&#x201D; said Rick Bouten, a software science student at the university. &#x201C;We think the elements of the car of the future are modularity and connectivity, it should be able to connect with other cars. As a driver you will have to do less and less and in the end the car will drive itself.&#x201D;</p><p>This kind of collaboration is not new to NXP, the company has worked closely with students in the past to produce projects such as the solar powered Stella &#x2013; the world&#x2019;s first solar powered family car. NXP supports innovation in all forms and is a willing partner for anyone looking to create a smarter world.</p><p>See the story of the Nova car below.</p><p><iframe title=\"The Car Of The Future\" width=\"1220\" height=\"686\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sdto7lt5kJc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>",

      "content": "<p>There have been several points, in the history of manufacturing, when technology has truly revolutionized the way products are made. In the early part of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the steam engine and electrification led to mass production, and in the 1970s, when robotics, computers, and other types of automation came on the scene, productivity got another big boost. Since then, though, technology has had more of an incremental effect on manufacturing, especially when you think about what&#x2019;s happened over the same period in other areas, such as information technology, mobile communications, and e-commerce.</p><p>But that&#x2019;s changing. The manufacturing sector has become increasingly digital, using connected systems to control complex, collaborative processes. Machines and products now communicate with each other, so as to cooperatively drive production. In this new way of working, a product can find its way through the production process independently, minimizing the need for human intervention, and reducing the chance of human error. The result is heightened productivity, with the ability to respond to changes faster than ever before, and the ability to customize on a grand scale &#x2013; all while reducing unit costs and saving energy.</p><p>This trend of digitization is more than an evolution, in terms of productivity, safety, and cost, and can legitimately be called a revolution. Analysts have, in fact, started calling this the fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0. The term refers to the use of a wide range of technologies, from semiconductor products like sensors and microcontrollers, to things like autonomous robots and simulators, big data and analytics, and, of course, cloud computing and the Internet of Things.</p><p>One of the newest additions to the mix is <a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/techzones/nfc-zone/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Near Field Communication<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, or NFC, which adds new levels of convenience, communication, and configurability throughout the manufacturing process.

We human beings are fragile: subjecting us to extreme temperatures can cause unhappiness, injury or death.</p><p>Although not as fragile as humans, it is also important that our electronic devices operate within acceptable thermal limits. Exposure to extreme temperatures can lead to <a href=\"http://www.electronics-cooling.com/2001/11/temperature-and-reliability-in-electronics-systems-the-missing-link/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">premature failure<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> and expensive running costs &#x2013; just two of the undesirable consequences of heat. Good thermal design is therefore an integral part of overall successful product design. It is not something that can be &#x201C;bolted on&#x201D; at the end of the process, two weeks before the product is due to be released. Rather, it should form part of the initial Product Requirement Specification and be an equal factor in influencing the configuration of the final design.</p><p>Nearly two decades ago, when I first began my career as a <a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/products/mosfets/standard_mosfets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Power Semiconductors<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> Applications Engineer, I had little awareness or knowledge of the field of thermal management. However, after being immersed in a multitude of power semiconductor design-in problems, it quickly became apparent that a thermal question lay behind at least half of those problems. In this way, by accident rather than by design, I found myself becoming as much a Thermal Engineer as an Applications Engineer. &#xA0;As such, a large part of my working life is spent either designing systems which are as energy efficient as possible (and hence generate minimal heat waste) or managing the heat which any real-life system will inevitably generate.</p><p>In the average home or workplace, most of the electronic bits and pieces scattered around will probably have had someone like me influencing their design. Whether it&#x2019;s the PC on your desk, the battery in your mobile phone or the electric lawn strimmer in your garden shed, thermal management is important. If the thermal management is poor then the appliance may run hot, have a shortened lifespan and cause pain and suffering to anyone who tries to pick it up or use it.</p><p>In this series of blog posts I would like to share with you some of the insights I have gained into how heat behaves at the component and PCB level. Much of what I have learnt is non-intuitive, and the process has sometimes been baffling and frustrating. However, on many of those occasions, frustration has eventually been rewarded with genuine &#x201C;Eureka!&#x201D; moments and true insight into behaviour which has not previously been fully understood. At those times, I am particularly happy to have accidentally become a Thermal Engineer.</p><p>Next time: Using thermal simulation tools to model reality. Can we trust the model?</p>",

      "url": "https://blog.nxp.com/smart-city/retail/smart-loyalty-mifare-drives-the-next-trend-in-retail",
      "content": "<p>The modern loyalty program, which rewards customers for their business, can be traced back to the early 1980s, when airlines began offering exclusive benefits for &#x201C;frequent flyers.&#x201D; The trend has been growing ever since, with the result that just about every kind of retailer now offers some kind of &#x201C;points&#x201D; or reward program as thanks for regular patronage.</p><p>It&#x2019;s easy to see why loyalty programs have become so popular: they work. In a 2014 study, the U.S-based research firm, <u><a href=\"http://www.technologyadvice.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Technology Advice<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></u>, found that 82.4% of consumers are more likely to shop at stores that offer loyalty programs. That&#x2019;s because these programs help consumers save money and get rewards. Whether it&#x2019;s a paper punch-card from the local coffeehouse, a plastic card with a bar-code used by a national grocery store, or a smartcard issued by an international hotel chain, loyalty programs let you receive special discounts, earn extra merchandise, or gain access to special, members-only services.</p><p>Loyalty programs based on mobile apps, which let you access the program through your smartphone, have only been around for a few years, but have caught on quickly. According to a recent report issued by <u><a href=\"http://www.bondbrandloyalty.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Bond Brand Loyalty<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></u> (formerly Martiz Loyalty Marketing), 73% of smartphone users are interested in using their mobile device to interact with a loyalty program.</p><p>The Technology Advice study, mentioned above, confirms this, saying that more consumers want loyalty programs tied to smartphone apps. But the study found the app on its own may not be enough &#x2013; the majority of shoppers polled prefer a hybrid system, involving a physical reward card tied to a digital network and a smartphone app. They prefer the hybrid approach because it gives them the best of both worlds &#x2013; a smartphone app for access to instant coupons or location-based discounts, along with a physical card that&#x2019;s easy to hand to a cashier.</p><p>Hybrid programs work best when the physical card is a contactless smartcard, because the contactless technology enables a number of added features. The smartcard can be used to store loyalty points, and can work in a multi-application environment, supporting added functions like micropayment or compatibility with cross-branded programs. One card can work for just about everything, from parking garages to vending machines and retail shops, to restaurants, VIP lounges, and resort spas.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/loyalty.png\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><br>\n<img class=\"alignleft size-large wp-image-4305\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/loyalty-1024x761.png\" alt=\"loyalty\" width=\"610\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/loyalty-1024x761.png 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/loyalty-300x223.png 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/loyalty.png 1040w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\"></a></p><p>Compared to a paper punch-card or a card with a bar code or magnetic stripe, a contactless smartcard is safer, because on-card data can be encrypted, more convenient, because the card is fast and easy to use, and more powerful, because the card can store extra information and be programmed for additional functions.</p><p>Deploying a contactless smartcard based on <u><a href=\"https://www.mifare.net/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">MIFARE<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></u> yields several advantages, in terms of security, convenience, multi-application functionality, and storage capacity.</p><p>MIFARE, which is the leading brand for contactless IC products, is already used in 736 cities worldwide. And, having shipped in more than 10 billion ICs, it&#x2019;s supported by more than 1000 business partners and an infrastructure that includes more than 150 million reader machines.</p><p>While MIFARE is perhaps best known for its use in transport (more than 80% of all contactless ticketing credentials deployed use it), MIFARE is gaining momentum in payment applications, too. Banks are moving quickly to drive adoption of contactless payments, and the massive rollout of contactless point-of-sale (POS) systems in retail offers great opportunities for companies wanting to deploy smart loyalty programs based on contactless technology.</p><p>A key feature of MIFARE is that it is fully compatible with <a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/techzones/nfc-zone/overview.html?page=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\"><u>Near Field Communication (NFC)</u><span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, the tap-and-go proximity technology now being deployed in a wide range of mobile devices, including smartphones and wearables. NFC-enabled phone shipments surged 300% in 2012, and are forecast by <u><a href=\"http://www.berginsight.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Berg Insight<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></u> to grow to 1.7 billion units in 2016. MIFARE is deployed in over 70 smart NFC devices, and that number is getting bigger every day. NFC and MIFARE are closely related, from a technology standpoint, so it makes sense for the two to be linked together. NFC devices work in the MIFARE infrastructure, which means any NFC-enabled device has the potential to work wherever MIFARE smartcards are used.</p><p>Choosing &#xA0;a MIFARE &#xA0;chip&#xA0; for a smart loyalty program enables design freedom and greater customization, since the contactless technology can be implemented in more than just cards. MIFARE chips can be designed into a thin, pliable sticker that can be affixed to the back of a phone (or a traditional wallet or card case), and used at pay stations. In similar fashion, MIFARE chips can also be designed into a key fob or wearables, for on-the-go convenience without the need to carry a purse or wallet. Loyalty programs can support different formats &#x2013; cards, stickers, wearables &#x2013; depending on the application and customer preference. The MIFARE ecosystem, which offers hardware building blocks, software tools, and design expertise, gives smartcard developers the flexibility to deploy the format and features best suited to their purpose.</p><p>MIFARE has an added advantage for developers working in the Android space, since the new <u><a href=\"https://www.mifare.net/en/products/tools/mifare-sdk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">MIFARE Software Developer Kit (SDK)<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></u> makes it fast and easy to create Android-based apps for MIFARE, NFC tags, and even ICODE RFID tags. The SDK forms part of the extensive ecosystem that supports MIFARE implementations, from mobile apps, reader ICs, and POS terminals, to expertise on security and NFC deployment.</p><p>For any retailer deploying smart loyalty programs based on MIFARE, the return on investment can be quite quick, since the program can increase business and create additional revenue streams. Support for micropayments, the ability to do more with a single card, and the option to update applications once cards are deployed, enhances the consumer experience and gives shoppers more reasons to use the program in the first place.</p><p>MIFARE.net site<br>\nhttps://www.mifare.net/en/</p><p>MIFARE SDK<br>\nhttps://www.mifare.net/en/products/tools/mifare-sdk/</p><p>NXP&#x2019;s NFC Everywhere TechZone site<br>\nhttp://www.nxp.com/techzones/nfc-zone/overview.html?page=</p>",

What is this guy droning on about you may be asking. Sit tight&#x2026;</p><p>Our new <a href=\"http://www.freescale.com/kinetis/vseries\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Kinetis V series<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> of ARM&#xAE; Cortex&#xAE;-M class MCUs has set embedded motor control in&#xA0;a new direction. Our&#xA0;motor control demo vault is filled with a vast array of industrial and appliance type creations as those have historically represented the biggest slice of the motor control pie. While such demos have performed admirably for many years and continue to do so, we thought that it was time to look further afield for an application befitting of our first ARM-Cortex-M7 based MCU. Motor control is after all, the largest consumer of electricity on the planet so presumably there must be an unknown talent out there just waiting for its turn in the spotlight.</p><p><strong>Men-less machines<br>\n</strong>After many hours of coffee and doughnut fuelled deliberations, the demo team settled on a drone. Why drones? The short answer is &#x201C;because washing machines don&#x2019;t fly very well&#x201D;. No, in all seriousness there are a number of reasons why the drone, UAV or quadcopter was deserving of its place. Firstly, it ticks the &#x2018;cool&#x2019; box. Defying gravity is always a neat trick but it now comes with added flair with drones now able to perform all types of aerial wizardry. Secondly, spinning multiple motors accurately is a task that our Kinetis V series MCUs take in their stride so it showcases the MCU&#x2019;s talents to good effect. Technical prowess box ticked. Thirdly, is the potential business opportunity associated with it. What began as a hobbyist play-thing is now rapidly transitioning into a viable commercial market of sizeable proportions and increasingly diverse end applications. These magnificent &#x201C;men-less&#x201D; flying machines are finding new destinations on an almost daily basis including aerial surveying of structures and farmland, cargo transportation to remote communities, and even shark spotting in California. The market is still at an embryonic stage with many regulatory hurdles to clear, but all the signs are that it won&#x2019;t be long before drones will be delivering pizza to your house (hopefully not dumped on your roof &#x2018;Breaking Bad&#x2019; style). In short, this application is&#x2026;.wait for it&#x2026;..taking off.</p><p><strong>4 x 8-bit MCU = 1 x 32-bit Kinetis V MCU<br>\n</strong>When it comes to motor control, our&#xA0;expertise is par excellence. Naturally I&#x2019;m biased, but decades of new product development, turn-key customer projects for the industry&#x2019;s &#x2018;big players&#x2019;, and a vast library of sophisticated enablement software speaks for itself. With that in store and Kinetis V series MCUs &#x2018;straining at the leash&#x2019;, the drone demo project was seized upon. Against an aggressive schedule &#x2013; typical of every trade show demo request from marketing I expect &#x2013; the development team was set in motion. Motor control passions were ignited and soon propellers would (hopefully) begin turning.</p><p>The drone selected was the DJI Phantom1 &#x2013; a workhorse of the market and hence a suitable platform with which to test our V series MCU&#x2019;s credentials. Propeller guards were also purchased to avoid any unfortunate finger incidents &#x2013; 8K rpm blades can cause quite a nip.</p><p>The Embedded Speed Controller (ESC) modules were the target area &#x2013; four per drone and each controlled by one 8-bit 8051 MCU. A new consolidated ESC design was manufactured using one KV5x ARM Cortex-M7 MCU where previously there had been four 8-bit MCUs. Leveraging the MCU&#x2019;s agile performance and highly integrated motor control peripherals &#x2013; 240MHz ARM Cortex-M7 core, high resolution PWMs, multiple high speed ADCs (5Msps) and its inter-peripheral crossbar &#x2013; a four off 6-step BLDC control system was implemented. This required approximately 50% of the KV5x MCU&#x2019;s CPU performance leaving additional bandwidth to implement field oriented control (FOC) and flight stability control functions in future ESC designs.</p><p>An additional KV4x ARM Cortex-M4 version of the ESC was built to demonstrate the unique scalability that the Kinetis V series brings to this and countless other motor control applications. One MCU family &#x2013; multiple end products, with scalable form, functionality and price.</p><p>By coincidence, the demo team discovered a parallel drone project using a&#xA0;new gate driver IC. A quick decision was made to join forces and include the GD3000, adding further power control capability while replacing several additional discrete components. More BOM cost reduction. With schematics drawn up, PCBs populated and software tested, the result was 2 new custom made ESC modules, and thankfully no missing fingers.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Drone-2.png\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12327 size-medium\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Drone-2-300x226.png\" alt=\"Drone 2\" width=\"300\" height=\"226\"></a> <a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Drone-1.png\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12328 size-medium\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Drone-1-300x225.png\" alt=\"Drone 1\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\"></a></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Up, up and away<br>\n</strong>The Kinetis V series drone made its maiden flight recently.

Draining company resources, coupled with revenue goals, can cause even the best ideas to fail. Sound all too familiar?</p><p>That&#x2019;s why our engineering team announced a new portfolio of Freescale products called the <a href=\"http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/taxonomy.jsp?code=SINGLE-CHIP-MODULE\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Single Chip System Modules (SCM)<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>. These are a suite of highly integrated system solutions in an ultra-small form factor. The first member of this portfolio, the Freescale SCM-i.MX 6Dual, reduces time to market by 25% over discrete solutions by integrating the i.MX 6Dual applications processor, PF0100 (PMIC) for power management, 16 MB SPI NOR, over a hundred discrete components, and is enabled for 1 or 2 GB LPDDR2. All of this is tightly packaged in an Android and Linux enabled BSP the size of a dime (17x14x1.7 mm).</p><p>That may just seem like a whole lot of acronyms, but to put it into perspective, check out the PCB space reduction achieved by the SCM-i.MX6D. Can you imagine how fast a first generation could get to market? Or what new features you could fit in all of that space for the second generation?</p><p>Beyond just getting you to market first, we also want to help keep you there. The SCM-i.MX 6D is enabled with the standard i.MX 6D security features (High Assurance Boot, cryptographic cipher engines, random number generator, and tamper detection) as well as enhanced system level tamper prevention. These features, coupled with the continued product support offered through our ecosystem partners, strive to keep your systems secure and at optimal functionality. This means a simpler supply chain, community support network, partners for PoP assembly, software enablement, and hardware design help.</p><p>Our goal with the SCM was to take care of the backend design work, and enable our partners to bring their ideas into reality. From wearables to home automation systems, the possibilities for application are endless. We can&#x2019;t wait to see what you come up with. Let&#x2019;s get to work.

      "content": "<p>Without motor control, our homes and lives would be far less convenient than they are today &#x2013; we&#x2019;d still be washing our clothes by hand, cooking over open fires and desperately searching for the nearest ice cave in which to chill our beers. Outside of the kitchen the effect would be equally troublesome &#x2013; HVACs replaced by hand fans, garage door/gate opening would require manual labor (shriek with horror!), and filtering the pool/jacuzzi would take months with only that lukewarm beer in hand to dull the pain. Jokes aside, motors are a <strong>BIG</strong> deal and represent a huge area of opportunity for electronic control using microcontrollers (MCUs), which bring increased automation and energy efficiency benefits to the appliance.</p><p>Within such applications, the MCU performs several functions. Its timers generate up to 6 channel PWMs which drive, via an inverter stage, the AC motor&#x2019;s 3-phases that essentially make the motor spin. Analogue to Digital (ADC) module(s) are used to measure the various phase currents to track the speed and/or position of the motor as it rotates, known as sensor-less feedback control.</p><p>Several household applications also use 2 motors: washing machine (big drum and pump), dishwasher (sprays the water and drains), fridge/freezer (compressors, air-flow to stop frost), and HVAC/air conditioner (compressors and air flow). Many MCUs contain two sets of 6 channel PWMs allowing <a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MotorImage_KV-Series.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-12256 size-full\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MotorImage_KV-Series.jpg\" alt=\"MotorImage_KV Series\" width=\"403\" height=\"403\"></a>them to drive two inverter stages and in turn spin two motors. Generally, the sensor-less monitoring of speed and position is completed using one or two ADC modules. Sensor-less speed algorithms work with less errors if they can simultaneously acquire two of the phase currents at specific times of the PWM period, but error adjustments can be made if only one ADC module exists, and the two phase currents are measured back to back. For driving a dual motor control application with two ADC modules, the application can assign one ADC per motor and include some error correction in the speed calculation. Alternatively, the dual motor drives can be synchronized by having one set of PWMs 180 degrees out of phase from the other, and making use of both ADCs for both motors by assigning different input channels. An MCU with four ADC modules allows true, independent dual 3-phase motor control which helps simplify application code and minimizes acquisition errors.</p><p>The trade-off that often arises in such integrated solutions is the cost of having four ADC modules, versus the level of power efficiency savings that will impact the end consumer.</p><p>The latest member of our&#xA0;fast emerging <a href=\"http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/taxonomy.jsp?code=KINETIS_V_SERIES&amp;cof=0&amp;am=0\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Kinetis V series<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> of ARM&#xAE; Cortex&#xAE;-M class MCUs &#x2013; the <a href=\"http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=KV5x\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Kinetis KV5x MCU family<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> &#x2013; is well equipped to handle the demands of multi-motor applications. With multiple timers, four high-speed ADCs (sampling at up to 5 Msps), and a 240MHz capable Cortex-M7 core, fully independent sensor-less control of two 3-phase motors can be accomplished with ease. With CPU MIPS to spare, the KV5x MCU can also perform other functions including adding secure internet connectivity via its on-chip Ethernet , multiple CAN and UARTs, and Encryption modules. With the embedded market currently ablaze with IoT (Internet of Things) concepts, the opportunity to remotely monitor and manage countless motorized appliances in the home and beyond can now be realized from the comfort of our armchairs, workplaces or further afield. So you can rest easy, thanks to the humble MCU it should be some time yet before we need to search for that elusive ice cave.</p><p>#KinetisConnects</p>",

There&#x2019;s masking tape in the photo here because it was not glued yet. Extra holes were cut in the back to increase the offset and account for the position of the lens on the camera.</p><p><a href=\"https://community.freescale.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-2126-38837/IMG_20150609_175247306.jpg\" data-content-finding=\"Community\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"image-1 jive-image\" src=\"https://community.freescale.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/38-2126-38837/1600-898/IMG_20150609_175247306.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20150609_175247306.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"898\"></a></p><p>As a contingency plan, I made a mount for the main button in the event that the clear acrylic case did not arrive. It&#x2019;s sitting on a black acrylic sheet cut to fit onto the top of the TV pillar.</p><p><a href=\"https://community.freescale.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-2126-38838/IMG_20150611_135015564_HDR.jpg\" data-content-finding=\"Community\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"image-2 jive-image\" src=\"https://community.freescale.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/38-2126-38838/1600-898/IMG_20150611_135015564_HDR.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20150611_135015564_HDR.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"898\"></a></p><p>But, in the end, the acrylic case did arrive just in time. Here are photos of the completed kiosk and acrylic cover. It&#x2019;s still awaiting being wrapped with images from last year&#x2019;s photo booth and branding.</p><p><a href=\"https://community.freescale.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-2126-38839/IMG_20150616_111804147.jpg\" data-content-finding=\"Community\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"image-3 jive-image\" src=\"https://community.freescale.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/38-2126-38839/505-900/IMG_20150616_111804147.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20150616_111804147.jpg\" width=\"505\" height=\"900\"></a></p><p>Below, the power inlet to the kiosk can be seen. It has an IEC 320 C14 inlet to which a standard power cord is attached. There is an integral switch in the inlet that controls power to the whole kiosk. Inside the door (the knob on the door is visible on the left), there&#x2019;s a dedicated router and a power strip. The WAN connection on the router feeds through the RJ-45 jack next to the power inlet. Above the door is a spring loaded recessed handle (with another on the opposite side) for lifting the kiosk.</p><p><a href=\"https://community.freescale.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-2126-38840/IMG_20150616_111824770.jpg\" data-content-finding=\"Community\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"image-4 jive-image\" src=\"https://community.freescale.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/38-2126-38840/505-900/IMG_20150616_111824770.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20150616_111824770.jpg\" width=\"505\" height=\"900\"></a></p><p>And here are some close-ups under the hood&#x2026;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Since the acrylic cover did come, the wood support for it is mounted to the case via the nut on the button. It&#xA0; serves mainly to hold the <a class=\"jive-link-external-small wpel-icon-right\" href=\"http://https//www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensy31.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer external\" data-content-finding=\"Community\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Teensy3.1<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> so that it can be seen. The admin button box inside the case serves to toggle the uploading of the images, re-aim the camera, and reboot and shutdown the whole system.

The button is held in place to keep from spinning with double sticky tape as is the wood support underneath. The nut holds it all together. It&#x2019;s all suspended by the top of the acrylic case.</p><p><a href=\"https://community.freescale.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-2126-38842/IMG_20150616_115315755.jpg\" data-content-finding=\"Community\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"image-6 jive-image\" src=\"https://community.freescale.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/38-2126-38842/505-900/IMG_20150616_115315755.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20150616_115315755.jpg\" width=\"505\" height=\"900\"></a></p><p>And here&#x2019;s the other side, showing the Hummingboard that controls the camera and runs the photo booth:</p><p><a href=\"https://community.freescale.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-2126-38843/IMG_20150616_115325453.jpg\" data-content-finding=\"Community\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"image-7 jive-image\" src=\"https://community.freescale.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/38-2126-38843/505-900/IMG_20150616_115325453.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_20150616_115325453.jpg\" width=\"505\" height=\"900\"></a></p><p>It&#x2019;s now ready for <a href=\"https://community.freescale.com/tags/#/?tags=ftf2015\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">FTF2015<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>. There&#x2019;s already been interest in using it at an internal event here in Austin some time in August&#x2026;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>I still want to make some improvements, though: like making the reboot and shutdown cycle shorter and adding sound effects and prompts. But those will have to wait until after FTF2015&#x2026;</p><p><strong><em>David DiCarlo is a&#xA0;hardware applications engineer for Freescale i.MX applications processors.</em></strong></p>",

Further, since running things logged in as root is frowned upon, how does a normal, unprivileged user signal a reboot?</p><p>Toward that end, I created a cronjob that runs as root every minute:</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blog6image1.png\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-12227 size-full\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blog6image1.png\" alt=\"blog6image1\" width=\"420\" height=\"63\"></a></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>It runs the Python script rebootcheck.py:</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blog6image2.png\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-12228\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blog6image2.png\" alt=\"blog6image2\" width=\"472\" height=\"230\"></a></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>The script checks for the presence of a file named &#x201C;reboot&#x201D; or &#x201C;shutdown&#x201D; in debian&#x2019;s home directory. When it finds a file so named, it will delete the file (so we don&#x2019;t end up in a repeating reboot/shutdown cycle) and then reboots or shuts down. This works because the cron job runs as root and and has the proper permissions to do so.</p><p>To deliver the photo booth pictures to the users, the script uploads the photos via FTP to a domain for which I have a hosting account. Once up there, the script shoots an email to <a class=\"jive-link-external-small wpel-icon-right\" href=\"http://ifttt.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer\" data-content-finding=\"Community\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">http:ifttt.com<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, which has previously been set up with a recipe to post to an album on a Facebook page.</p><p>Why the circuitous route to uploading the images to the page on Facebook? The short answer is that there is easy/obvious/pre-existing method to do so via a command line driven script. There once was a PHP command line script that could but Facebook changed their API about two years ago and broke it. The author never fixed it.</p><p>I wont bother posting the code here since it can be seen in libsocialmedia.py and credentials.py (which doesn&#x2019;t exist in the git repository, it comes from credentials-template.py, since it&#x2019;s really bad form to publicly share passwords and stuff&#x2026;).

The first four are of the pillar that both TVs mount on. The last two of of a small button box that will sit inside the enclosure for administrative functions. These buttons will be able to shutdown and reboot the kiosk. It may do more, possibly even play a game of Simon, but there&#x2019;s not much time to implement that before FTF 2015&#x2026;</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blog6image3.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-12229\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blog6image3.jpg\" alt=\"blog6image3\" width=\"505\" height=\"899\"></a> <a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blog6image4.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-12230\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blog6image4.jpg\" alt=\"blog6image4\" width=\"621\" height=\"900\"></a> <a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blog6image6.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-12231\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blog6image6.jpg\" alt=\"blog6image6\" width=\"505\" height=\"899\"></a> <a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blog6image7.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-12232\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blog6image7.jpg\" alt=\"blog6image7\" width=\"1313\" height=\"900\"></a> <a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blog6image8.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-12233\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blog6image8.jpg\" alt=\"blog6image8\" width=\"1029\" height=\"900\"></a></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><strong><em>David DiCarlo is a hardware applications engineer for Freescale i.MX applications processors.</em></strong></p>",

The mouse and joystick profiles are not used at all. Button presses are converted into keystrokes&#xA0;using the keyboard profile. The serial port is used so that the photo booth script can blink the LED that illuminates the button.</p><p>To connect the button to the Teensy, I used an extra board I previously had made to mate with the Teensy. The board was originally designed to accommodate five buttons and drive 8 channels of FETs.</p><p>It also was meant to piggy back onto the Teensy, as not seen in the photo above (the breakout board is underneath the green board). Since the FTF photo booth kiosk is going to be on display, I thought it important to see the Teensy and breakout board. Below is a photo of the kiosk&#x2019;s button boards boards. As populated, only the one switch is connected <img class=\"alignleft wp-image-12215 size-medium\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blog5image2-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"blog5image2\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\">along with one FET to drive the button&#x2019;s LED.</p><p>The Teensy is programmed using the Arduino software. The maker of the Teensy has a plug in for the Arduino tool that translates the compiled code into&#xA0;a form usable on the Teensy 3.1 hardware and by the Kinetic K20 at the heart of it. It also has several different USB devices already set up &#x2013; you just choose them from the pull down menu.</p><p>The code is basically unmodified from my 5 button version. I had to commenting out the blue button because that line needs a pull resistor to keep it from repeatedly sending a character (a better choice before spinning the board could have avoided this&#x2026;). More buttons will be added inside the enclosure for administrative functions.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Here&#x2019;s a photo of the button and board connected to the kiosk board:</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blog5image3.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-12216 size-medium\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blog5image3-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"blog5image3\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\"></a></p><p>To install Linux on the Hummingboard, I used <a class=\"jive-link-external-small wpel-icon-right\" href=\"http://www.solid-run.com/learning-center-ignition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer external\" data-content-finding=\"Community\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Solid Run&#x2019;s Ignition<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> installer. You download it and dd it to a microSD card, stick it into the board, and give it network. It boots to a GUI where you can select from a number of distributions. I clicked the show all, since I wanted to install Debian Wheezy and it was not in the default list. It reformats the card and installs the chosen distribution from the network. It&#x2019;s a pretty slick installer compared to the gyrations required to put Linux on other boards. Once it finishes installing, it reboots and you&#x2019;re up and running with the new OS.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Once installed, I had to fix one of the apt-get sources in /etc/apt/sources.list. As installed, the line with &#x201C;<a class=\"jive-link-external-small wpel-icon-right\" href=\"http://repo.gbps.io/BSP:/Cubox-i/Debian_Wheezy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer external\" data-content-finding=\"Community\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">http://repo.gbps.io/BSP:/Cubox-i/Debian_Wheezy/<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>&#x201D; did not work. After searching the web for a bit, I found two replacement repositories that did work instead: &#x201C;<a class=\"jive-link-external-small wpel-icon-right\" href=\"http://repo.r00t.website/BSP:/Cubox-i/Debian_Wheezy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer external\" data-content-finding=\"Community\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">http://repo.r00t.website/BSP:/Cubox-i/Debian_Wheezy<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>&#x201D; and &#x201C;<a class=\"jive-link-external-small wpel-icon-right\" href=\"http://obs.gbps.io:82/BSP:/Cubox-i/Debian_Wheezy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer external\" data-content-finding=\"Community\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">http://obs.gbps.io:82/BSP:/Cubox-i/Debian_Wheezy/<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>&#x201C;.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>With sources.list fixed, I did &#x201C;apt-get update&#x201D;, followed by &#x201C;apt-get upgrade&#x201D; and &#x201C;apt-get dist-upgrade&#x201D; to bring everything up to date. This was all required since one of the later packages would not build until the dist-upgraded was performed. Here&#x2019;s the list of things that were subsequently installed:</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Since I will be in Michigan while the kiosk is at FTF in Austin, I need to make sure that it runs relatively unattended. That means, it just has to work with little attention and assuming that there are no debugging resources available.</p><p>Toward that end, the scripts need to start running when the boards boot up. At first I was invoking the script with a line in /etc/rc.local. This isn&#x2019;t so great an idea because it runs as root and it never actually ends up even logging in &#x2013; the script is invoked as by a root level process at the very end of linux launching. While it worked, running things automatically as root is probably not the greatest idea.</p><p>According to Google, editing /etc/inittab and adding &#x2013;autologin in should have done the trick&#x2026;&#xA0; But apparently not so much with the Debian image installed by <a class=\"jive-link-external-small wpel-icon-right\" href=\"http://www.solid-run.com/learning-center-ignition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer external\" data-content-finding=\"Community\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Solid Run&#x2019;s Ignition<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> installer. No changes to inittab had any effect, so I had to take to digging into all the instances of getty in the image&#x2026;</p><p>As it turned out, this particular Debian image uses systemd. The inittab file is still in place, but there are configuration files under /lib/systemd/system that control the logins via getty. The file where I had to add in the &#x2013;autologin was /lib/systemd/system/getty@.service.<br>\nNow, with autologin accomplished, I wanted to configure it so that the script only ran when logged in as the non-root user on tty1. To do this, I edited the .profile script in the user&#x2019;s home directory and added the following:</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>This allows me to log in as &#x2018;debian&#x2019; via ssh or another tty without attempting to launch another instance of the script.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Another invaluable tool to administrating these boards is <a class=\"jive-link-external-small wpel-icon-right\" href=\"http://www.webmin.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer external\" data-content-finding=\"Community\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Webmin<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>. I used it to create the non-root user &#x2018;debian&#x2019;, set things up so that the board would go out and find an ntp server to set the machine&#x2019;s time (there is no real time clock on these boards), and to set the permissions for &#x2018;debian&#x2019; so that it could access the framebuffer and input devices. Webmin is very much your friend.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Given that time is passing rapidly, I gave some thought to the enclosure for the kiosk this week and drew up some plans. The plan is to encase the two TVs, board, button, and other things in a clear acrylic enclosure on top of a pedestal. So, here&#x2019;s a diagram of the pieces for the acrylic cover:</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blog5image4.png\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12217 size-full\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blog5image4.png\" alt=\"blog5image4\" width=\"367\" height=\"525\"></a></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t have any CAD software handy, so I just sketched up what the kiosk top will look like:</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blog5image6.png\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12219 size-full\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blog5image6.png\" alt=\"blog5image6\" width=\"450\" height=\"346\"></a></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><strong><em>David DiCarlo is a&#xA0;hardware applications engineer for Freescale i.MX applications processors.</em></strong></p>",

      "content": "<p>At the end of 2014, Gartner stated that there could be as many as 4.9 billion connected &#x2018;things&#x2019; in use this year alone. That&#x2019;s a lot of devices collecting and sharing data with each other to control the environment around us. And it is a potential security nightmare for consumers, equipment manufacturers and infrastructure owners alike. How can we trust the devices we use, the networks they connect to and other devices that they interact with?</p><p>As an individual, we want to be sure our private data stays secure, whether on our own mobile phone, over the internet or when stored in the cloud or a company&#x2019;s database. And we want our devices to be protected against viruses or hacks that could not only give others access to our information but cause them damage as well. But at the same time, security should be invisible, as we don&#x2019;t want to have to remember lots of passwords or constantly authenticate transactions using complicated security procedures.</p><p>For equipment manufacturers, there are issues around liability. Who is to blame when a product gets hacked? And how much damage could a security breach do to your brand and market share? Infrastructure owners face similar challenges around liability and reputation. Additionally, a security breach could cause significant downtime or damage to the network, connected devices and services.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/internet-of-things_high_res.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4276\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/internet-of-things_high_res-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"internet-of-things_high_res\" width=\"610\" height=\"343\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/internet-of-things_high_res-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/internet-of-things_high_res-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/internet-of-things_high_res.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\"></a></p><p>How can we best address all these different aspects of security? According to the <a href=\"http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEFUSA_IndustrialInternet_Report2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">World Economic Forum&#x2019;s 2015 Industrial Internet of Things report<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, &#x201C;Organisations will need new frameworks that span the entire cyber physical stack, from device-level authentication and application security, to system-wide assurance, resiliency and incidence response models.&#x2019;&#x2019; There are a variety of aspects to security which can be examined to identify the best solution with the smallest investment and cost.</p><p>The level and uncertainty of cost is biggest when a security breach actually happens. For companies this is not only the cost of recovery from a breach but also the harm to the brand, impact on market share and the potential legal costs resulting from a breach.</p><p>Key management and certification are ongoing processes that pose considerable costs and have some uncertainty. For key management, it is necessary to secure production lines which could have an impact on production flow, manufacturing flexibility and even the project schedule. The certification process can be even more problematic through, for example, delays due to needing to recertify a product as a result of a patch.</p><p>Yet all these costs could be easily reduced through investment in a good security design. That does not mean simply downloading a cryptographic software stack. There are too many examples of where software vulnerabilities have resulted in security breaches, with the &#x2018;Heartbleed&#x2019; bug being one of the most recent.</p><p>Authentication is a key requirement of a good security design and is critical for building trusted infrastructures. But authentication requires cryptographic techniques to prove identity of devices and high tamper resistance to protect a device or sensitive information stored on it.</p><p>Embedding hardware security solutions like our <u><a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/documents/leaflet/75017594.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">A70CM turnkey security solution<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></u> addresses system and device security by isolating crypto operations and keys in tamper resistant hardware. This is a major step towards raising overall system security and trust in the system.</p><p>Also, security modules like these significantly facilitate secure deployment and management of equipment in the field. Only by improving the security design of equipment can we create the levels of trust needed for IoT connected embedded systems. Does that mean spending a little more on security design? Yes it does. But would you rather have a quantifiable additional design cost at the start of your project, or deal with the potentially massive fallout from a major security breach due to a vulnerability in your product or system?</p>",

Just look at the telephone and the way millennials and younger generations use it to talk to each other without ever opening their mouths to speak. The communication is still there, but the talking &#x2013; the thing the telephone was invented to do &#x2013; has begun to fade.</p><p>Similarly, SDN and NFV are evolving away from their roots. Look no further than their connection to each other to see what I mean. When NFV was first introduced by 18 carriers at Mobile World Congress in 2012, it was positioned as a technology that would benefit from, but not depend on SDN. Today, the two technologies are practically married through a strong relationship between the Open Networking Foundation (ONF) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). ONF is working on the first ONF-sponsored NFV proof of concept on service chaining using OpenSDN technology. With a strong liaison relationship in place, OpenSDN will now be driven by NFV use cases that will take OpenFlow beyond the data center into carrier networks and into the customer premise.</p><p>But that&#x2019;s not the only way SDN is changing and not all of it is for the better. Increasingly, I&#x2019;m seeing more and more OEMs talk about SDN in a way that sounds great, but is really just a perpetuation of the closed network. They&#x2019;re creating a network that is more software-driven, but it still operates like a black box, keeping operators out of the networking equipment. This is appealing because it seems simpler to manage than a full SDN network, but it also reduces the benefits that SDN can deliver. Even OpenDaylight, which has a strong community behind it, might be limited on this front.</p><p>But all hope is not lost. ONF has increasingly been talking about OpenSDN, a standard that all the different OEMs can adhere to. This creates interoperability between the hardware vendors, but maintains the decoupling between data path and control path so that the programmability and flexibility that SDN promises is still available. ONF&#x2019;s new reference designs for OpenSDN will emphasize both OpenDaylight and ONOS. This prevents one single entity from driving the architecture and the technology in a certain direction, hence helping maintain the community&#x2019;s openness. This will also allow SDN to develop in a way that allows applications to tell the network what it needs (its intent), rather than direct the network what to do, and then let the control plane of the network determine how it meets the applications needs.</p><p>ONF has also created an open source community for code development, allowing anyone to participate. This will allow network operators to become increasingly involved and have some sense of ownership over the code, putting in the support and the man effort needed to develop it further. As the code continues to develop in this community, I expect that within 3-5 years, we&#x2019;ll start seeing a healthy software community to manage the hardware without the need for an embedded solution OEM to dominate the market.&#xA0; This will also allow for network operators to have a heavy hand in deciding how the network behaves.</p><p>After all, SDN started in universities, where it was a very open environment.&#xA0; In a way, this is SDN getting back to its roots. If an open source community can do 80 percent of the work, software developers can focus 100 percent of their time on the remaining 20 percent of the code, focusing exclusively on innovation and differentiation. By sharing, we&#x2019;ll move the networking field forward faster than if we create our own silos.</p><p>&#xA0;</p>",

      "content": "<p>I&#x2019;ve been thinking about the connection between the color of light in a room and how we feel. What got me started on this was a session I attended, at the US Department of Energy&#x2019;s <u><a href=\"http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/betterbuildings/summit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Better Buildings Summit<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></u>, &#xA0;hosted by Dr. Steven Lockley, of Harvard University, and Dr. Lori Brock, of Osram Lighting.</p><p>Dr. Lockley is an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and an associate neuroscientist, in the area of sleep medicine, at Brigham and Women&#x2019;s Hospital in Boston. He&#x2019;s measured how the human body reacts to color stimulation, and has published his conclusions in multiple research papers.</p><p>In Dr. Lockley&#x2019;s session, I learned that how we respond to lighting is one part biology and one part physics, since our bodies react to the particular energy associated with a given color. Red lighting, for example, puts us to sleep. In nature, the human eye is conditioned to respond to red, in the form of sunsets and firelight, as a signal that the day is done. Our bodies respond to red light with a chemical reaction, involving the release of melatonin, and we get sleepy. Blue lighting, on the other hand, is the color of early morning, as the sun rises, and our bodies react to it by waking us up and making us more alert.</p><p>Dr. Lockley described a study he&#x2019;d conducted with Dr. Brock and Osram Lighting, in Germany. The study used two identical classrooms, except one had normal &#x201C;warm-white&#x201D; lighting, which has a high red component, and the other had &#x201C;cool-white&#x201D; lighting, which has more blue. After several months, the students swapped classrooms. At the end of the study, the number-one complaint from students was that they found it impossible to sleep during &#x201C;boring&#x201D; classes when they were in the classroom that used the cool-white (blue) lighting. Dr. Lockley has even found that exposure to blue light is more effective than caffeine as a stimulant. A few minutes of exposure to high-intensity blue lighting leads to hours of increased alertness.</p><p>I spoke to Dr. Lockley after his presentation, and told him about an experience I&#x2019;d had flying cross-country. I hadn&#x2019;t been able to nap because the overhead lights were blue. Dr. Lockley said he&#x2019;d heard this before, and had contacted airplane manufacturers and airlines to tell them about the stimulating effects of blue lighting. He finds that many people think blue is a &#x201C;calming&#x201D; color in lighting when, in fact, it&#x2019;s the opposite.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/iStock_000050575182_Large.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4271 \" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/iStock_000050575182_Large-1024x683.jpg\" alt width=\"472\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/iStock_000050575182_Large-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/iStock_000050575182_Large-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px\"></a></p><p>Using some of the concepts explored by Dr. Lockley, I can create different lighting effects at home, depending on how I want to feel. RGB LEDs, which use red, green, and blue lights to produce a broad array of colors, are the starting point. When connected to a network, the lights can be programmed for different situations, and can respond to things like the time of day or changes in the weather. As bedtime approaches, for example, the lights can take on a red hue, to help me relax. Or, if it&#x2019;s grey and cloudy out, the lights can use the blue spectrum to brighten my outlook and give me a mental boost. Either way, I&#x2019;ll be using what can truly be called &#x201C;mood lighting&#x201D; to increase my wellness and improve my state of mind.</p><p>Other articles on lighting by Roman Budek</p><p>IoT Puts a Jolt Into Traditional LED Lighting Designs<br>\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/JoltLight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">http://bit.ly/JoltLight<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p><p>Networking Landscape for IoT LED Lighting<br>\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/NtwkLight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">http://bit.ly/NtwkLight<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p><p>LED Lighting for the IoT Invites Sensors to Play a Major Role<br>\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/SensorsForLighting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">http://bit.ly/SensorsForLighting<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p><p>NXP solutions for lighting<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/applications/lighting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">http://www.nxp.com/applications/lighting/<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p>",

To avoid the Christmas lights being controlled separately, I had to cut off the plugs on some sacrificial Christmas lights to serve as the controlled outlets!</p><p>I had since wanted to do a project upgrade, using&#xA0;regular AC duplex outlets to control&#xA0;many more lights and fit it all into a portable, rugged &#x201C;box&#x201D; of some sort.</p><p>As with any project, I started off with some thoughts:</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image1.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"wp-image-12170 aligncenter\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/iamge-2.jpg\" alt=\"magic in a cooler whiteboard planning\" width=\"659\" height=\"488\"></a></p><p>Initially, I had wanted to use a cheap, black toolbox to house the AC circuits. But after some measurements of the interior, it seemed a bit cramped for what I wanted to add and the walls seemed too thin to support installing the&#xA0;&#x2018;blue boxes&#x2019; needed to properly contain the AC outlets.</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image-3.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-12174 aligncenter\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image-3.jpg\" alt=\"Blue Coleman cooler with broken hinge\" width=\"3200\" height=\"2368\"></a></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Fortunately, I was cleaning out the garage around this time and taking stuff to Goodwill. As I picked up this blue Coleman cooler with broken lid hinges, it hit me that this would be the perfect container for a portable music and light show:</p><p>It has 1&#x2033; thick walls, lots of room inside, a handle, and wheels! The broken lid was actually a plus as it allowed removal of the lid and made it easier to work inside. Now to get to work!</p><p><strong>Electricity and Safety<br>\n</strong><span style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; line-height: 1.6;\">I wanted first and foremost for the AC part to be as safe as possible. Just like in the walls in your house, what that means is containment of all connections via blue boxes and a master junction box. It also means having a circuit breaker or a ground-fault circuit interrupter. I chose the latter.</span></p><p>Step 1: Install the AC blue boxes and outlets in the sidewalls of the cooler.<br>\nI wanted to have 10 outlets total as I have 10 relays available for control, which means having 5 duplex outlets. I also wanted a simple light switch to help to turn off all exterior outlets if necessary, for safety reasons and to permit debugging code and music without having to worry about driving the external lights. The outlets were planned to be on the &#x2018;back side&#x2019; of the cooler.<br>\nOut came the cutting tools&#x2026;</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMAGE-4.png\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"wp-image-12175 aligncenter\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMAGE-4.png\" alt=\"Magic cooler cut out\" width=\"771\" height=\"774\"></a></p><p>Normally, in a house wall you&#x2019;d want to attach these blue boxes to a stud behind the drywall. However, in this case the plastic exterior and interior of the cooler were tense enough to support the boxes.</p><p>The next step was to loosely install the AC outlets to check the fit. I planned to remove them again later when doing the final wiring so here I just installed them as a placeholder.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/iamge-5.png\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"wp-image-12176 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/iamge-5.png\" alt=\"removed the tab connecting the hot sides\" width=\"714\" height=\"471\"><br>\n</a></p><p>Since I wanted to individually control the outlets, I removed the tab connecting the hot sides together. I used pliers to wiggle the tab back and forth to break it off. I then installed 10 outlets and one switch.<br>\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12177\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/iamge-6.jpg\" alt=\"Power outlets in magic cooler box\" width=\"271\" height=\"366\"></p><p><strong>Wiring<br>\n</strong>Step 2, wire up the AC circuit. &#xA0;Here&#x2019;s a diagram showing the AC side of the circuit:</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/iamge-7.png\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-12178 aligncenter\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/iamge-7.png\" alt=\"AC circuit board\" width=\"942\" height=\"339\"></a></p><p>Basically, power comes in to the cooler via a 3-prong wire (hot-neutral-ground) and goes through a master switch and a&#xA0;<a href=\"http://ecmweb.com/content/how-gfcis-work\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">GFCI outlet<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>&#xA0;which will be located in a separate&#xA0;blue box inside the to protect the remaining outlets downstream. &#xA0;Color coding when working with AC circuits is VERY important: Black connects to black, red to red, ground to ground. Let&#x2019;s follow each line separately:</p><p>I used #12 Romex to do the wiring, although I probably should have used something for the short runs here as #12 isdifficult to work with (hard to bend), but at least now I know the circuit is very robust!<img class=\"alignright wp-image-12179 size-full\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image-8.jpg\" alt=\"Magic cooler box wiring\" width=\"302\" height=\"226\"></p><p>I ran the 3-wire Romex box to box just as is done in a house wall. However, after the first set of duplex outlets the hot (black) wire was removed from the Romex bundle and brought down to where the&#xA0;future junction box would be. &#xA0;Red wires&#xA0;were connected to the hot side of each of the 10 outlets and were also run down to where the junction box would eventually be.</p><p>I decided that the&#xA0;GFCI receptacle and master switch should be&#xA0;located inside the cooler. &#xA0;The GFCI provides some protection from accidental touching, wires coming loose creating shorts, and would help if I ever planned to take the cooler outside. &#xA0; It would&#xA0;also serve as a standard outlet to power the microcontroller board and other accessories.</p><p>Since the cooler already had a nice, convenient drain hole, I decided to use that to run the main power cord. &#xA0; I cut the power cable from a 10-outlet power strip with confidence that it had sufficient current-carrying capacity. A knot was added to prevent accidental tugs on the power cord from damaging the internal wiring.</p><p>Next step, the&#xA0;junction box.</p><p><strong>Junction Box Prep<br>\n</strong>The junction box was used to house the bus terminal to expand the single hot (black) wire to the 10 relays and the connection of those relays back to the switched outlets (red wire). &#xA0;In case of any electrical fire or loose wire, the box would serve as containment and/or ground.</p><p>Some electrical stuff is just cheaper to get on Ebay than at your local hardware store, so I found a really nice and <img class=\"alignright wp-image-12181 size-full\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ebaybox.jpg\" alt=\"ebay box\" width=\"240\" height=\"302\">strong junction box&#xA0;on Ebay&#xA0;that&#xA0;was the perfect size.</p><p>Next, I had to&#xA0;pop out the 1&#x2033; and 3/4&#x2033; holes in the box (not easy!) in order to insert cable clamp connectors. &#xA0;These served to hold any wires going into and out of the box and prevent them from rubbing against the edge of the metal hole. I screwed the&#xA0;box to the bottom of the cooler to hold it in place. &#xA0;I made the junction box door open to the side opposite the blue boxes, to permit easy access.</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMAGE-9.png\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-12182\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMAGE-9.png\" alt=\"Junction box, hole cutting and wiring\" width=\"1109\" height=\"353\"></a><strong>Junction Box Wiring<br>\n</strong><span style=\"font-size: 1.4rem; line-height: 1.6;\">This was probably the trickiest part of the entire build &#x2013; wiring up the relays and the bus terminal block and mounting them inside the junction box IN THE BOTTOM OF A COOLER.</span></p><p>Basically a bus terminal block is just a way to connect heavy gauge wire together.</p><p>By using short U-shaped pieces of the hot (black) wire and ring terminal connectors, I was able to use the bus terminal block to help connect the line hot wire to the Normally Open (NO) side of the 10 relays.</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bus-terminal-block-2.jpg.png\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-12185\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bus-terminal-block-2.jpg.png\" alt=\"bus terminal block wired up\" width=\"846\" height=\"345\"></a></p><p>Since I had already mounted the junction box into the cooler, I made a template out of a old box that had the same dimensions of the interior of the box so I could do most of the the wiring in a more comfortable way.</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bus-terminal-block-3-wired-up.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12187\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bus-terminal-block-3-wired-up.jpg\" alt=\"bus terminal block 3 wired up\" width=\"296\" height=\"396\"></a></p><p>Given that #12 Romex is very stiff, this was the best way to ensure that the final assembly would in fact fit into the box. &#xA0; Although, if I had to do it over again, I would probably have used a smaller gauge wire, as with #12 it was very difficult to interface with the relay terminal blocks. &#xA0;I had to &#x2018;encourage&#x2019; them to connect&#x2026;</p><p>Get in there&#x2026;<img class=\"alignright wp-image-12188\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/testing-boundaries.jpg\" alt=\"testing boundaries\" width=\"272\" height=\"204\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-12186\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/broken-piece.jpg\" alt=\"broken piece\" width=\"283\" height=\"210\"></p><p>Or not. This is what happens when you force 12-gauge Romex into relay&#xA0;terminal block. This board had to be replaced. However, we made it in the end!</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image10.png\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-12189\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image10.png\" alt=\"finished wiring\" width=\"847\" height=\"731\"></a><strong>Enclosing<br>\n</strong>Now that the AC wiring was done, the next step was to enclose all AC circuitry to prevent mishaps. Well, in reality, the next step was to test all the connections with an ohmmeter before connecting the AC! This step is vital during ALL stages of AC wiring.</p><p>To enclose the exterior outlets and light switch, we decided to add weatherproof covers. These were readily available at the hardware store.</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/waterfproofing.png\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-12190\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/waterfproofing.png\" alt=\"adding waterproof outlet covers to the coleman cooler\" width=\"727\" height=\"471\"></a></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Note that we still need to caulk the gap (like you would at your house) around these enclosures if we truly want the cooler to be waterproof. The covers were numbered with which relay they were connected. I cared more about the relay order being numbered sequentially than the outlets.<br>\nThe next step for safety was to enclose the entire interior of the cooler with an acrylic &#x201C;lid&#x201D;, so the curious could still <img class=\"alignright wp-image-12191\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/cooler-protective-cover.jpg\" alt=\"cooler protective cover\" width=\"362\" height=\"269\">view the interior, but do so safely. The idea was that all AC circuitry would be below the lid, and all DC or microelectronics and prototyping related stuff would be sitting on the lid like a shelf.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>The cooler provides a nice lip around the top of the inside where the lid/shelf fits and since it&#x2019;s very thin doesn&#x2019;t interfere with placing the cooler top/lid in place. The cooler lid actually has a large interior as well so you can still fit several inches worth of stuff on the acrylic lid/shelf.<br>\nIn order to fit the hole exactly, we used a laser cutter to round off the corners. Cardboard test pieces (not shown) <img class=\"alignright wp-image-12192\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/finished-coleman-case-part-1.jpg\" alt=\"finished coleman case part 1\" width=\"363\" height=\"269\">were put into the laser cutter until we got the corner exactly right then the same design was reused on the acrylic. Due&#xA0;to limitations of the interior of the laser cutter, we had to use two separate pieces of acrylic.<br>\nTo join the two parts of the lid together, two handles were 3D printed and attached. Holes were drilled to make room for additional wiring and a notch was added to one side for the audio power plug.</p><p>Now we just needed to hook up the microcontroller to the relays to control the lights and speakers!<br>\nStay tuned for Part 2 of this article!</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p>",

Talk of 5G has begun to ramp up over the last six months and major wireless carriers are beginning to issue significant global announcements about their plans for a 5G world. But how did we get here?</p><p>Fifteen years ago, 2G brought the world digital voice transmission, SMS and mobile Internet. For the first time, we had people-to-machine connectivity, albeit at much lower speeds than what we are used to today. Email was the first application to gather widespread interest, which took advantage of the mobile Internet.</p><p>From there, we advanced to 3G, which brought higher data rates and the capability to support simultaneous voice and data. At first, adoption of 3G was slow. Voice and SMS were still the primary applications, and 2G speeds were still acceptable for email to the phone. However, with the advent of the smartphone, the consumer soon developed the taste for nomadic computing, with consumers streaming video and compulsively checking their Facebook accounts. The increased demand heralded 3G HPSA +, and suddenly we saw the advent of the tidal wave of data that is still rolling today.</p><p>Today&#x2019;s 4G technology offers higher levels of bandwidth, but our appetites for bandwidth-intensive services like streaming video have grown much larger. Over 75% of mobile data today is video driven by smartphones but the quality leaves much to be desired. As tablets and smartphones become larger in form factor, consumers expect 1080p quality video. The bottom line is that while 4G does its job well, and offers significant improvement over 3G in terms of latency, bandwidth and overall connectivity, it has only created demand for faster and higher quality service that can&#x2019;t be met by today&#x2019;s technology.</p><p><b>The next generation</b><br>\n5G will be the wireless standard of the future. The wireless community is still debating the details of 5G, but the overarching goal is achieving the ultimate user experience. From a bandwidth perspective, the global objective of 5G is to deliver 100 Mbps for everybody, everywhere. Many have even referred to 5G as the &#x201C;fourth utility,&#x201D; since ubiquitous broadband access is so important for both businesses and individuals in today&#x2019;s world. 5G is going to be the launching point for more application convergence. The market is already focused on fixed and mobile network convergence for typical communications applications, but there is much more on the horizon. Low latency wireless connectivity is imperative to providing fast machine-controlled responses to enable autonomous cars, the wireless factory and elements of the Internet of Things.</p><p>2G/3G/4G technologies have enabled the start of the Internet of Things, however 5G will be the enabler of the &#x201C;tactile&#x201D; Internet, essentially sensor and actuator networks. For example, factory automation, process control and robotics are technology areas ripe for wireless innovation. Today, we see pockets of industrial WiFi used in very specific applications, but a low latency, deterministic, high-bandwidth wireless technology could completely revolutionize the factory floor by providing the fail-safe wireless connectivity necessary to connect machines within a wide variety of applications.</p><p><b>5G &#x2014; stretching the boundaries</b><br>\nIt is going to take some significant and fundamental changes: The industry will need 10x more spectrum, 10x better spectral efficiency and 10x more cell density in order to achieve the desired 1,000 bit area density improvement. The need for increased bandwidth in dense deployments becomes obvious if you have ever tried to use your mobile phone in a sports arena.</p><p>In order to achieve this significant improvement in capability, network operators will need to make several changes to their wireless networks. Wireless cell infrastructure density will need to rapidly increase such that we end up with an almost viral network that can scale as we need it. This will mean including a variety of cell sizes and architectures beyond the traditional macro network deployments. In order to achieve the 10x increase in spectrum, 5G will be forced to expand into the millimeter wave arena, possibly exceeding 80GHz, compared to the sub 4GHz spectrum used by previous generations of wireless networks.</p><p><b>Planning for 5G</b><br>\nIt is expected that 5G systems will be deployed beginning in 2020, which is now less than five years away. Most major economies around the world have already started to lay very significant plans for 5G. Consortiums are being formed all around the world to determine the specifications that will need to be in place by 2020 to allow for the natural progression of 5G. The European Commission has already allocated over &#x20AC;700 million to be spent between now and 2020 to enable 5G technology.</p><p>While some of the transition to 5G will be revolutionary, such as the adoption of millimeter wave frequencies, which will require new infrastructure and mobile devices, there will be evolutionary changes as well that are starting with 4G networks today. Network densification has already started with 4G, network operators are deploying small cells, DAS and centralized RANs to keep up with data demand in dense urban networks.</p><p>SDN is already being introduced to networks today to help operators manage their transport networks that provide backhaul to wireless base stations. This will extend to include management of the wireless equipment as well, helping network operators coordinate multiple wireless technologies and vendors to provide seamless connectivity to consumers. NFV will provide operators with the flexibility to quickly roll out new services and adapt to changing network requirements, and this can also be adopted with today&#x2019;s generation of wireless network equipment.</p><p>There is an impressive array of technology that is planned for the transition to 5G that will enable many new possible services. It will be exciting to see which killer app will drive the direction of 5G development.</p>",

Traditional servers are very energy- and space-intensive, not to mention pricey. On top of that, the majority of the energy cost in a traditional server environment comes from moving data from point A to point B, rather than from processing the raw data into value-add information (i.e., analytics). What is needed in this era of analyzing &#x201C;big data&#x201D; is a trusted architecture that combines the data with the high-performance compute.</p><p>Creating compute-dense processing nodes or appliances that are hyper-efficient&#x2014;with ultra-low power, small form factor and high performance compute nodes&#x2014;are built by integrating a system-on-a-chip (SoC) processor with DRAM (Dynamic random-access memory), flash memory, and the power conversion logic using open standards interfaces and software. These appliances are emerging as a new option for more efficient data processing per dollar spent.</p><p>Each compute node in the appliance consists of a 12-core, 24-thread SoC, 48GB DRAM, 2 SATA*, 4 10Gb Ethernet, SD and USB2 interfaces&#x2014;yet is only 139 mm wide by 55 mm high and uses an inexpensive DIMM (dual in-line memory module) connector. 128 of these nodes are provided within each appliance which consumes about 6 kW. It runs standard Fedora 20 Linux and the IBM DB2 database. IBM researcher Ronald Luijten calls their creation the &#x201C;datacenter in a box.&#x201D; Ronald and his co-authors, Dac Pham, Mihir Pandya, and Huy Nguyen, presented the results of this work to date at the<a href=\"http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=%201325829&amp;page_number=10\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">2015 ISSCC conference</span><span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>.</p><p></p><p>*Exabyte: A unit of information equals one billion gigabytes.</p><p>*SATA: An integrated drive electronics (IDE) device, which means the controller is in the drive, and only a simple circuit is required on the motherboard.</p><p>In another example, System Fabric Works demonstrated another implementation at Super Computing 2013 using the exact same SoC, which they called the &#x201C;strongest candidate for low power exascale*.&#x201D; These two examples demonstrate that combining powerful, low-power compute with the integration of networking infrastructure on a single SoC can enable an appliance platform to scale efficiently to Exabyte levels of performance.</p><p>*Exascale: A computing system capable of a billion billion calculations per second.</p><p><strong>What are some of the use cases that compute-dense appliances are uniquely suited for?</strong></p><p>Low-power, compute-dense analytic appliances have not yet fully come into their own. Right now, it is common to rely on the established data center technology. As big data continues to grow, and the business value of getting to the answers quickly and efficiently becomes the demand, rather than paying for the movement of data, a paradigm shift will take place. As this shift occurs, high-performance multicore processors will be needed to help address many challenges to optimize the system architecture for their specific application requirements.</p><p>Projects like DOME, work being done with deployments in developing regions, and other uses will pave the way for a new generation of compute-dense appliances to meet our local, low power, higher efficiency compute needs.</p><p>&#xA0;</p>",

Traditionally, these systems have been small in number with relatively few locations, such as network operation centers, generating plants and substations. They were isolated from public networks and relatively easy to secure. It was possible to physically secure the locations with fences and locked doors and the isolation allowed virtual locks and fences to be easily added.</p><p>But smart grid technology is changing all of this. With smart meters, smart thermostats and appliances, utility companies would like to network all of the data and provide tools to the consumer for monitoring and managing their home energy consumption. This requires the deployment of a large number of intelligent devices to monitor and control the distribution networks. Depending on the location, these devices may be physically accessible and may also be more accessible digitally through the utility or public network.&#xA0; As the touch points into the utility network become more numerous, the requirements for heightened cybersecurity become a necessity. Cybercrime costs the global economy $400 billion to $575 billion a year and $100 billion in the United States alone, according to a report from security software maker McAfee (now part of Intel Corporation).</p><p>Critical infrastructure such as the power grid has to be protected against malicious viruses or malware such as <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/11/countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Stuxnet<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, which was unlike any other virus or worm that came before. Rather than simply hijacking computers or stealing information from them, it caused physical destruction of equipment that the systems controlled, in this case, a PLC.</p><p>To protect against these types of threats, systems in the Smart Grid network need to support multiple levels of security, which means technology that can:</p><p>A secure operating system is not sufficient to provide the protection needed. Having dedicated hardware to enforce security policies is critical to ensure a system can be trusted. Fortunately, the technology needed to support these security mechanisms is readily available and is supported by today&#x2019;s multicore processors, with a combination of both dedicated hardware for performance and software for flexibility needed to meet various system power and performance requirements.&#xA0;Most of the devices also support Secure Boot as well as run time protection.&#xA0;IPSec, as well as link layer encryption using MACSEC, are common in multicore processors to deliver high performance hardware encryption for end-to-end security.</p><p>While multicore-based systems help equipment makers protect their systems against cybercrime, additional system and network level precautions should also be taken to further reduce the risk. &#xA0;IT departments must be proactive in installing firewall appliances and delivering the appropriate software updates to block potential network attacks. As the need for security is at an all-time high, these security tactics are crucial in protecting critical infrastructure against viruses or malware.&#xA0; Without these tactics in place, cybercrime could become more than the $575 billion issue security software vendor <a href=\"http://www.mcafee.com/uk/resources/reports/rp-economic-impact-cybercrime2.pdf\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">McAfee claims it is<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>.</p>",

But we are much less familiar with the technology that provides the compute power for these cell towers: the baseband unit that is typically hosted &#x201C;at the bottom of the tower.&#x201D; The baseband unit is home to both custom hardware blades that are complex, expensive and difficult to maintain and the proprietary software that runs alongside them. Because so much of the system is proprietary, custom or complex, cost issues quickly arise for both operators and system vendors, which eventually translate to the mobile phone bill. Operators rely on a variety of vendors to deliver this networking equipment, adding to the complexities of wireless networks and leading to a disjointed experience. A solution is needed to integrate multiple wireless standards and multiple software sources on a single hardware platform to offer a unified approach to deliver seamless wireless connectivity for our mobile devices.</p><p>Enter virtualization, which opens the door of opportunities for both operators and users by seamlessly integrating various vendors&#x2019; stacks, features and standards at a lower cost by removing issues related to proprietary implementations. Let&#x2019;s take a look at these benefits and how they are achieved.</p><p><strong>Lower cost</strong><br>\nPutting as much functionality as possible into general purpose compute hardware and non-proprietary software allows for cost effective development, deployment and maintenance. Because each base station is unique with varying platform requirements, virtualization targets only those applications that are suitable for a virtualized environment. By virtualizing part of the base station, it is not only easier for operators to have the same functionality without propriety hardware and software driving up costs, but also easier for system developers to develop the base station in general, leading to faster innovation cycles and thus a better end user experience.</p><p><strong>High levels of integration </strong><br>\nIn many cases, operators are challenged by having to manage a complex network built on equipment from different vendors and access standards, which can create a disjointed user experience.</p><p>Software-defined networking and virtualization through network function virtualization standard and mechanisms allows multiple access standards (including Wi-Fi, LTE, millimeter-wave support for 5G) to run under the umbrella of a single platform, enabling both a lower time-to-market and a better user experience through tight integration of these multiple standards. This also allows base station manufacturers to integrate software sources from a range of different vendors, offering both a flexible option for operators and a seamless user experience.</p><p><strong>Enabling new business models</strong><br>\nAdditionally, virtualization grows the top line for network operators/service providers by enabling them to leverage new business models through the use of new applications at the edge of the network. For example, latency sensitive applications such as augmented reality or enterprise services require wireless data access within a specific geographical area &#x2013; where traffic doesn&#x2019;t need to be backhauled through the core network. Virtualization allows network operators to seamlessly deploy such additional applications. As vendor networking solutions can be quickly and easily integrated, network operators get a chance to differentiate through innovation.</p><p>Virtualization helps to ensure the network can smoothly evolve to meet the needs of the future by allowing operators to integrate upcoming protocols into the network without having to replace the network all together. For example, as the roll-out of 5G networks begins to take form over the next five years, 5G standards and benefits will be seamlessly integrated into the infrastructure with limited equipment changes. The virtualized base station is backwards compatible, allowing continued support for previous generations, such as LTE, while also deploying new technologies. This flexibility will be critical in enabling network operators to develop new business models beyond the current voice and data services.</p><p>By enabling simpler and easier integration of multiple standards and multiple software sources on a single hardware platform, virtualized base stations are able to meet both current and future demands of operators and users alike.</p><p><strong>Does this mean we can replace base stations with servers?</strong><br>\nFollowing the thinking outlined above, one might assume that base stations can/will be replaced by standard off-the-shelf servers that you can buy them from established IT/data center vendors. However, this may prove to be a bit too simplified. The challenge is to provide a platform that provides the benefits from virtualization without paying any penalty compared to those proprietary platforms mentioned earlier. Think about latency requirements where responsiveness needs to be orders of magnitude better than in IT environments (tens of microseconds), and use of specific hardware acceleration (physical layer processing, IPSec secure tunneling, encryption, etc.). The challenge for vendors is combining the efficiency of proprietary hardware with features of general purpose compute and virtualization.</p><p>&#xA0;</p>",

The slideshow script progressed so that it now pulls the images from the web server running on the photo booth kiosk&#x2019;s camera computer rather than using SAMBA file sharing. In addition, instead of checking the director index for a new image, the camera computer writes the number of the newest composite to a file on the web server.</p><p>The latest version of the script copies the image files locally and caches them. This allows the remote display to pull the images files only once, reducing network bandwidth. With SAMBA sharing, the files were transferred through the network every time they were displayed. Only the composite images are copied at this point but the whole set of raw images and print strips can be copied as well for redundant backup.</p><p>The camera computer can issue commands to the remote display(s) via a text file containing the command. So far, the commands implemented are clearcache, quit, reboot, and shutdown, all of which should be pretty self explanatory. More commands can be added as the need arises. These commands are issued in one directly only, to the remote displays. The camera computer has no way of knowing (at this point) if an issued command has been received and acted upon.</p><p>So here&#x2019;s a photo of the remote display showing a test image with a Freescale logo&#x2019;ed emblem for FTF 2015:</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/slideshow1.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-12128\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/slideshow1.jpg\" alt=\"slideshow1\" width=\"1599\" height=\"898\"></a></p><p>Instead of attaching another snapshot of the slideshow script, here&#x2019;s a link to the <a class=\"jive-link-external-small wpel-icon-right\" href=\"https://github.com/ftfpbk/remotedisplay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer\" data-content-finding=\"Community\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">github repository<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> instead. There are vestiges of the original booth that remain in the slideshow code because that&#x2019;s where the slideshow originated &#x2013; the camera capture part was removed and just the image displaying parts were retained.</p><p>Now, moving on to the actual photo booth script&#x2026; Here&#x2019;s the link to the companion <a class=\"jive-link-external-small wpel-icon-right\" href=\"https://github.com/ftfpbk/photobooth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer\" data-content-finding=\"Community\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">github repository<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> for the code for the camera computer. There are comments in the code, which are hopefully readable. (It should also be noted that the author has little formal training in good coding practice, so please keep that in mind when perusing his pasta programming&#x2026;)</p><p>Because a DSLR is not being used in this booth, the open source components libgphoto2 and piggyphoto are no longer required. To pull the images off the USB webcam, <a class=\"jive-link-external-small wpel-icon-right\" href=\"https://github.com/gebart/python-v4l2capture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer\" data-content-finding=\"Community\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">v4l2capture<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> is used. The camera is put into video mode so that it&#x2019;s always running. This allows the camera&#x2019;s auto exposure system to continually adjust so that there need not be a wait for that before each still image is taken. This will have the later advantage of giving users a preview of what&#x2019;s in the camera&#x2019;s frame before the photos are snapped (this has yet to be implemented, however).</p><p>The webcam&#x2019;s aspect ratio does not match that of the Nikon DSLR, 1.7778:1 vs 1.5:1. I chose to crop the image from the webcam to the DSLR aspect ratio because it increased the vertical height in the frame with the given background width at FTF. Cropping the image also allowed using the composite generating portion of the photo booth script nearly as-is.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s a shot of the photo booth script running with some branding added in. The <a class=\"jive-link-external-small wpel-icon-right\" href=\"http://solid-run.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer\" data-content-finding=\"Community\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Hummingboard<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> can be seen in the center, it has the two orange connectors on it.

At the moment, there&#x2019;s nothing connected to it, but the 52mm arcade button to the right of it soon will be via a custom interface board. The Teensy needs to be connected at the moment because the photo booth script expects a serial port (/dev/ttyACM0) to be connected. I have not yet modified the code so that a command line argument will ignore the serial port.</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/slideshow3.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-12130\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/slideshow3.jpg\" alt=\"slideshow3\" width=\"1599\" height=\"898\"></a></p><p>Some of the things still remaining to do:</p><p><em><strong>David DiCarlo is a&#xA0;hardware applications engineer for Freescale i.MX applications processors.</strong></em></p>",

NXP and its partners have now embedded passive ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) RFID tags into key fobs, as well as readers in sales counters and inside the lock boxes where customers deposit keys when the office is shut.</p><p><strong>Driving change for improved customer satisfaction<img class=\" wp-image-4235 alignright\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/car-rental-2_small-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"car rental (2)_small\" width=\"343\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/car-rental-2_small-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/car-rental-2_small-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/car-rental-2_small.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px\"> </strong></p><p>Sixt, based in Germany, operates 2,200 branches worldwide and has a total fleet of 144,000 rental vehicles. One of the key challenges for this large organisation is streamlining the process of allocating cars to customers and ensuring they don&#x2019;t have to wait too long to get the car they want. Not only would this make the company more efficient but it would increase customer satisfaction and retention.</p><p>With the new RFID solution in place, Sixt has a much better view of exactly what cars it has in stock and the current location of the car keys. Previous to the implementation of the solution it could take up to three minutes to find a key, whereas now it only takes 20 seconds &#x2013; at a busy airport branch that can deal with more than 600 rentals a day this is a huge potential time saving.</p><p>RFID readers are even installed in key trays for freshly cleaned cars. Staff at the rental office now know which cars are out, which are in and which vehicles are cleaned and ready for rental. The improved speed of service and availability of desired vehicles has already reduced the number of customer complaints by 30 per cent. Disputes about the exact time of returned vehicles have also dropped as RFID can provide accurate time information.</p>",

But still, in reality, some of these new switches are not quite as open, flexible and programmable as they seem on the surface.</p><p>Put simply, a switch is either SDN or traditional. The main difference between these two categories is the software called an OpenFlow Agent (OF-Agent), which takes SDN commands coming from the controller and translates them into a language the switch can understand. But many of the &#x201C;SDN switches&#x201D; in the market today do not allow the network operators an access to the OF-Agent, making it next to impossible for the operators to change anything about the switch. This can make it unfeasible for companies to use equipment from various vendors, as the implementations of the OF-Agent can vary wildly from vendor to vendor. This reduces interoperability and keeps customers locked in with a specific vendor and its capabilities.</p><p>However, for sure, there are also true bare metal switches, where the software and hardware are sold separately, allowing the end-user to load software of their choice, instead of relying on a vendor. Further to that, there are also ways to get around the attempted vendor lock in of the so-called SDN switch. The Open Network Install Environment (ONIE), is an Open Compute Project open source initiative, which defines an open &#x201C;install environment&#x201D; for bare metal network switches where end users have a choice among different network OS. By taking over ownership of the software, companies are no longer forced to rely on a specific vendor for software needs and updates. This allows companies to actually control those so-called open SDN switches through software. More importantly, it allows legacy, traditional network systems to migrate to a SDN system without replacing existing hardware and thus offering lower-cost and a more flexible switching alternative.</p><p>Open vSwitch(OVS), a production quality open-source software implementation of a distributed virtual multilayer switch, aids in SDN adoption and effective network automation. OVS allows for overlay networking, which is a computer network built on the top of another network. This allows the underlying network to behave in a traditional way and two virtual machines on two different servers to be connected to each other directly by a piece of software.</p><p>In conclusion, the future of networking relies more and more on software. Per the November 2014 <em>IHS Infonetics Carrier SDN and NFV Hardware and Software</em> market size and forecast report, revenue from SDN software (orchestration and controller, and network apps) will grow from $46 million in 2014 to $1.7 billion in 2018, with a 2013&#x2013;2018 CAGR of 185%. Also in 2018, SDN+NFV software is 77% and hardware is 23% of total service provider SDN/NFV revenue. SDN and NFV (Network Function Virtualization) represent the shift of focus from hardware to software. Software is the key that unlocks the capabilities and benefits of SDN for any switch on any network. You just have to know where to look and apply!</p><p><strong>Hardware vs Software Revenue, 2018 &#x2013; </strong><em>IHS Infonetics Carrier SDN and NFV Hardware and Software</em> market size and forecast report, November 2014</p>",

By decoupling the data plane from the control plane, operators gain flexibility on various fronts &#x2013; in terms of the hardware they choose, the software to go with it and the way their network operates. One of the biggest advantages of SDN is that it opens up the hardware market to increased competition. Currently, large OEMs charge premium prices for their equipment, driving propriety standards that lock customers into purchasing all their hardware from one vendor.</p><p>But with the increase in bare metal equipment that will come with SDN, operators no longer need to be locked in and will be able to pick and choose equipment from different vendors. It will result in OEMs to compete against each other on a variety of different features and differentiating points, including price, which will inevitably drive down equipment costs. Many look at this as one of the chief benefits of SDN. Demand for more bandwidth is rising exponentially and carriers are struggling to keep up, while keeping costs down. Reduced equipment costs due to increased programmability in the network can only help.</p><p>However, an important point to note is that equipment costs are unlikely to go down enough to make a significant dent in operators&#x2019; balance sheets. What they really need is a way to drive increased revenue. While the focus on reducing costs is good, those who are looking at SDN to aid their balance sheet need to be focus more on the increased service agility that SDN provides rather than commoditization.</p><p>By decoupling hardware from software, carriers are freed from the OEM product cycle churn. In a traditional network, if you wanted to roll out a new feature or service, you would first need to go talk to your OEM vendor, who would in turn have discussions with its business channels, put your request on the roadmap, and then introduce it to the market. There holds two problems. First, the new feature or service is finally supported on the product long after the initial request was made, making it difficult for carriers to respond to immediate market needs. Second, it provides that feature or service to not only that single customer which made the initial request, but also to other customers, who are likely competitors.</p><p>But with SDN, new features and services can be introduced in software &#x2013; quickly, easily and selectively. Carriers can test a new feature in a key market to see how their customers respond. It can then be rolled out more broadly if it&#x2019;s a hit, driving new revenue streams and even bringing in new customers in a very short duration.</p><p><em>Per Infonetics &#x201C;2014 SDN and NFV (Network Function Virtualization) Service Provider Research&#x201D; &#x2013; the 2 primary factors driving Service providers to SDN/NFV are Service Agility and the global view of network across multiple vendors.</em> This increased service agility allows carriers to not only differentiate themselves, but also increase their revenue per end user and respond to market needs quickly. This is a much more effective way for carriers to accommodate the costs of increasing need for bandwidth than decreasing equipment costs. SDN has many benefits and by focusing on the ways it increases revenue, rather than just the ways that it cuts costs, it becomes an easier decision to begin implementing it.</p><p>&#xA0;</p>",

      "content": "<p>I&#x2019;ve been thinking, recently, about how far we&#x2019;ve come with mobile phones. Little more than a decade ago, around 2002, I had a phone that was about the size of a brick and weighed about as much. It made calls, and even sent text messages. I had to use a complex series of clicks on the numeric keypad to compose a text, but it didn&#x2019;t matter. I thought my phone was a technological marvel and used it with pride.</p><p>2002 was also the year that NFC worked with Sony to co-invent Near Field Communication (NFC). One of the ideas behind the technology was that it would let people exchange business cards electronically, by bringing their phones together. I think it&#x2019;s safe to say that NFC has more than surpassed that initial goal. Now seen as one of the most important additions to mobile phones in recent years, especially in the area of mobile payment, NFC has come to represent a fundamental shift in how we think about making purchases and exchanging information.</p><p>The infographic below traces the history of NFC and its impact on mobile phones. It also shows that we here at NXP Semiconductors recently met an important milestone with NFC and embedded secure elements shipments, reaching more than a billion units (1.26 billion, to be exact). What the infographic doesn&#x2019;t show is two other recent achievements &#x2013; a collaboration with Qualcomm that will accelerate the adoption of NFC and secure elements in mobile devices, and news that our secure elements will be part of the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S6 in China.</p><p>Seeing how far we&#x2019;ve come with NFC makes me think about how much farther we&#x2019;re likely to go. I doubt that, back in 2002, I would have believed all the things I can do with my phone now, and it&#x2019;s intriguing to imagine what the next decade will bring.</p><p>Care to weigh in?

A curiosity that parents and teachers know all too well as children are very inquisitive &#x2013; constantly asking questions about the world around them. Feeding that curiosity is important because as we grow older, it becomes increasingly more difficult to find the time to learn new things. In my job, I am so fortunate to be surrounded by market-leading technologies that help make the world a smarter and more secure place. At the heart of these technologies are engineers, who have fostered their curiosity &#x2013; turning those questions of &#x2018;why&#x2019; and &#x2018;how&#x2019; into the next greatest things.</p><p>Regardless of your profession, I think we all still harness a curiosity at times about how things work and perhaps even have ideas on how to make things better. For example: Ever wonder why your remote control batteries have to be replaced so often or how the tray in your microwave spins around?&#xA0; Or what makes your refrigerator run?</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Refrigerator.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-12109 alignright\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Refrigerator.jpg\" alt=\"Refrigerator\" width=\"348\" height=\"305\"></a></p><p>Enter Kinetis MCUs &#x2026; It is no secret that Kinetis MCUs are &#x2018;connected&#x2019; to people, making things better for our lives every day.&#xA0; Whether we realize it or not, MCUs are an important part of our daily lives; from the moment our alarm clock goes off in the morning until the moment we finish our book and turn off the eReader for the evening. In fact, even the bed we sleep in may be using an MCU.&#xA0; Microcontrollers are embedded in almost every device connected to power or a battery. I would venture to say that the average household has at least 50 electronic gadgets and appliances with MCUs in them &#x2013; spanning from your garage door opener to your smart watch, and everything in between. The increasing popularity of microcontrollers in end products is because MCUs are more full-featured, lower cost, and easier to develop with than ever before. Kinetis MCUs in particular, are focused on the following four key areas to make the experience even better for the engineers designing with them and the consumers using the end products.</p><p><strong><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-12108 size-full\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1Lock.png\" alt=\"1Lock\" width=\"82\" height=\"78\"><a href=\"http://www.freescale.com/kinetis/security\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Security<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></strong> &#x2013; But with the added privilege of connectivity, comes the increasing responsibility to secure it all. We want to make sure that only authorized users are seeing our information, using our devices, and that the devices in our home are not easily accessed by hackers. The security features of the Kinetis MCUs are designed to prevent unwanted attacks and protect the device.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2Connectivity.png\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-12107 alignleft\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2Connectivity.png\" alt=\"2Connectivity\" width=\"84\" height=\"78\"></a><a href=\"http://www.freescale.com/kinetis\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Connectivity<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></strong> &#x2013; Our homes are getting smarter. I am old enough to remember the days before remote controls &#x2013; when changing the channel required us to physically get up and change the dial. The wireless remote control was invented as a way to connect the user and the TV remotely. That idea has spanned throughout much of the home and the way in which devices connect is more advanced than ever. The thermostat is talking to the ceiling fan, the home alarm system is talking to the iPAD, and I feel like my kids are able to control way too many things around the house just from their gaming system.&#xA0; Integrated into Kinetis MCUs are smart ways for the devices to connect with each other &#x2013; both wireless and wired connections.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/3-low-power.png\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-12106 alignleft\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/3-low-power.png\" alt=\"3 low power\" width=\"66\" height=\"78\"></a></strong><strong><a href=\"http://www.freescale.com/kinetis/lowpower\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Low Power <span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></strong>&#x2013; Have you ever missed the opportunity to capture a video or picture of an important milestone because your camera battery died or got disconnected from something important as the battery icon on your phone drifted to 0%? The low-power capabilities of Kinetis MCUs enable longer battery life and are more &#x201C;green&#x201D; for the environment by helping save on overall system power.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4-Ease-of-user.png\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-12105 alignleft\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4-Ease-of-user.png\" alt=\"4 Ease of user\" width=\"71\" height=\"78\"></a><a href=\"http://www.freescale.com/kinetis/sw\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Ease-of-Use<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> </strong>&#x2013; Kinetis MCUs are enabled by a variety of software and hardware tools. Just like a hammer and screwdriver make it easier to build a house, tools like the Freedom boards and Kinetis SDK make it easier to build the next great electronics product. By making Kinetis MCUs easier to use and design with, we allow the engineers to focus their time on new features and added differentiation.</p><p>As the world of technology continues to evolve, I&#x2019;m excited to see what the future holds. But it first starts with you and your curiosity. What challenges do you have with technology today? How could you use Kinetis MCUs to design the next great thing? Comment below and let us know.

Its a separate monitor and board which is connected via a dedicated local network to the computer in the booth. To date, there has only been one remote display but several can be placed around a venue to stir up excitement and share the joy from the photo booth.</p><p>In the original incarnation of the booth, the remote display used a stock Android application that met two simple requirements: it could play a slide show via Windows file sharing and it would periodically refresh the directory contents so that new images from the photo booth would show up in the slide show.</p><p>Upon exiting the old booth, people often looked for the image they just generated. The canned Android app could not do that nor was it something easy the author of the app could add (I asked). As for me, the learning curve to write an Android app that did exactly what I wanted was even steep&#x2026; Eventually I realized that I already had the tools and skills at hand to write my own slide show, and quite easily: I could use Pygame just like I did for the computer in the booth.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s a very high-level flow chart of the new remote display slide show script:</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SlideshowFlow.png\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12061\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SlideshowFlow.png\" alt=\"SlideshowFlow\" width=\"397\" height=\"724\"></a></p><p>Instead of using SAMBA sharing like the original booth, the booth computer will be running a web server with directory indexing.</p><p>After the slide show script starts, it queries the booth web server to see if there is a new photo ready. If there is, the new file is copied locally and then displayed immediately. The new image holds on the screen for a longer period than older images&#x2014;10 seconds versus 3 seconds at the moment, but this may change&#x2014;giving people a chance to see and discuss it. Once an image is finished displaying, the web server is checked again for a new image. Once all the existing images have been displayed, the sequence in which they are played is shuffled.</p><p>In the case of the old booth, there was network activity every time a new image was display during the slide show. In this new slide show script, each photo is copied to the remote display board. This reduces the load on the booth computer because each image is copied only once per remote display. In addition to the composite image, I plan to have the script copy over the raw files as well, creating a redundant backup of all the images.</p><p>A snapshot of the script files as of 5 May 2015:&#xA0;<a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/libslideshow.py_.txt.zip\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">libslideshow.py.txt<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/slideshow.py_.txt.zip\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">slideshow.py.txt<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p><p>Some things that still need to be added are (and there are probably more, too):</p><p><em><strong>David DiCarlo is a&#xA0;hardware applications engineer for Freescale i.MX applications processors.</strong></em></p><p>\n</p>",

      "content": "<p>If you still carry a wallet (or something similar, like a credit-card case, a billfold, or a change purse), you may not be carrying it for much longer. Now that nearly every major smartphone manufacturer supports NFC, most of today&#x2019;s smartphones now have the power to make payments, and that could spell the end for your wallet.&#xA0;<a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/will-your-phone-replace-your-wallet.png\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4206\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/will-your-phone-replace-your-wallet-1024x365.png\" alt=\"will your phone replace your wallet\" width=\"610\" height=\"217\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/will-your-phone-replace-your-wallet-1024x365.png 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/will-your-phone-replace-your-wallet-300x107.png 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/will-your-phone-replace-your-wallet.png 1429w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\"></a></p><p>Consider a few stats, and you&#x2019;ll start to see just how close we are to having smartphones replace wallets. To begin, NFC-enabled cellphone shipments are expected to quadruple, reaching 1.2 billion units, by 2018 (<a href=\"http://press.ihs.com/press-release/design-supply-chain/nfc-enabled-cellphone-shipments-soar-fourfold-next-five-years\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">IHS Technology<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, 2014). This rapid growth means more people will have smartphones that can make payments, so there&#x2019;s less reason to carry cash or credit cards.</p><p>Next, some of the biggest names in smartphones and payment are pushing for the use of phones as wallets. In 2013, Samsung and Visa announced a major <a href=\"http://contactlessintelligence.com/2013/02/25/visa-and-samsung-sign-global-alliance-on-mobile-payments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">partnership<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> to develop mobile payments using NFC, and, in 2014, Apple introduced the iPhone 6 with Apple Pay using NFC technology. Both announcements serve to encourage merchants to start supporting the new format.</p><p>Moving to the other side of the payment transaction &#x2013; that is, to the infrastructure point of view &#x2013; there is growing demand for the machines that process contactless payments, referred to as point-of-sale or POS terminals. The market for POS terminals is expanding quickly, and is expected to maintain rapid growth through 2019 (<a href=\"http://www.berginsight.com/ReportPDF/ProductSheet/bi-pos-ps.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Berg Insight<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, 2015). That means people with NFC-enabled smartphones will have more places to make payments.</p><p>Also in the mix is the fact that the mobile POS (mPOS) sector, which only became a distinct category of its own a few years ago, is already experiencing exponential growth, with a forecasted CAGR of more than 42% through 2017 (<a href=\"http://www.paymentscardsandmobile.com/power-mpos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">paymentcardsandmobile.com<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, 2014). Of particular note is the fact that even very small and micro businesses, which traditionally run on cash only, are adopting mPOS formats to support electronic payments. Again, more places where cash isn&#x2019;t needed.</p><p>Transitioning away from paper-based money and credit cards to mobile payments can be seen as good for consumers and merchants alike. For consumers, it reduces, and might even do away with, the need to carry cash or hunt for nearby cash machines, and for merchants, it enables a range of innovative service options, such as instant rewards, real-time coupons, and other personalized services, which can enhance the purchasing experience and increase loyalty.</p><p>For all this to work in the long run, though, two things are needed. First, everyone involved &#x2013; consumers, merchants, service providers, banks, regulatory agencies &#x2013; must be confident that payments made with NFC-enabled smartphones are truly secure. And second, making payments with NFC-enabled smartphones has to be just as easy, if not easier, than making payments with traditional money and credit cards.</p><p>Time will tell just how ready consumers and merchants are to adopt this new way of doing business, but we can begin to build trust and deliver convenience by using widely agreed-upon standards, and by encouraging industry collaborations and partnerships. By using standardized and compatible technologies, and by working together, across industries and applications, we can ensure that smartphone payments are both seamless and secure.</p><p>As someone who&#x2019;s involved with NFC technology on a daily basis, I&#x2019;m excited about the future of smartphones as a replacement for paper money, coins, and credit cards, but that future is still some way away. So I still haven&#x2019;t fully retired my wallet. Maybe soon, but not just yet.</p><p>How about you?

When I walk into a room, I want the room to know it&#x2019;s me and give me &#x201C;the usual&#x201D; &#x2013; my favorite combination of lights, my favorite room temperature, maybe my favorite playlist &#x2013; you get the idea.</p><p>Luckily for me, wireless technologies are at a point where this is possible. Without having to flip a switch, push a button, or turn a knob, my surroundings can know it&#x2019;s me and can automatically create the environment I like best. The concept involves low-energy proximity sensing, which is a technique now supported by two widely used <u><a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/techzones/wireless-connectivity/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">wireless protocols<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></u>, <u><a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers/key_feature/bluetooth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> </u>and<u> <a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/documents/user_manual/JN-UG-3076.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">ZigBee<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></u>.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s how it works: a beaconing device, built into my smartphone, wristband, or some other kind of wearable, sends out a low-energy signal at regular intervals, in much the same way that a lighthouse or navigational system does. The beaconing signal contains a unique user ID (UUID), and when I enter a room, the room&#x2019;s network receiver picks up the signal and reads the UUID. The UUID is associated with settings &#x2013; light levels, thermostat temperature, and so on &#x2013; each configured to my liking, and the network automatically uses those settings.</p><p>Beaconing is different from GPS. A GPS device only finds my location coordinates, saying, &#x201C;Here. Here. Here.&#x201D; But a beaconing system provides identification along with the location. It says, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s me, Roman, and I&#x2019;m here.&#x201D;</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SmartBuildings.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-4191\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SmartBuildings-300x223.jpg\" alt=\"SmartBuildings\" width=\"300\" height=\"223\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SmartBuildings-300x223.jpg 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SmartBuildings.jpg 568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"></a>Beaconing can be used with a wide range of home-automation tasks. For example, the front door can unlock as I approach, and the alarm system can turn off as soon as I enter. No more fussing with keys or having to remember a code for the alarm. Or, if my daughter breaks up with her boyfriend, there&#x2019;s no need to rekey the locks, since access is electronically limited, immediately, at the press of a button. Beaconing can save on utility bills, too, since anything that uses energy &#x2013; lights, ceiling fan, gas fireplace, even holiday decorations &#x2013; can turn off automatically when I leave the room.</p><p>Adding sensor technology to the mix makes it possible for settings to change as my situation changes. Let&#x2019;s say I just went for a run &#x2013; I&#x2019;m hot, and I don&#x2019;t want the room to be as warm. The network can sense this, and lower the thermostat until my body temperature returns to normal. The same is true if I&#x2019;ve been sitting for a while: the network can sense my body temperature is lower, and turn up the heat a few degrees to compensate.</p><p>Beaconing promises to deliver on my vision of a truly automated home. After all, I want to be warm, without bothering with the thermostat, and I want my lighting to be just right, with my preferred color settings and illumination levels, without fumbling with switches. In other words, I want to be the guy who gets the usual, simple as that.</p><p>Technologies driving the smarter world (video)<br>\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1GvSqiJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">http://bit.ly/1GvSqiJ<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p><p>TechZone page for wireless connectivity<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/techzones/wireless-connectivity/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">http://www.nxp.com/techzones/wireless-connectivity/overview.html<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p><p>NXP&#x2019;s ZigBee home automation guide<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/documents/user_manual/JN-UG-3076.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">http://www.nxp.com/documents/user_manual/JN-UG-3076.pdf<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p><p>NXP Bluetooth Smart connectivity<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers/key_feature/bluetooth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers/key_feature/bluetooth/<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p><p>NXP solutions for wired lighting networks<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/applications/lighting/wired-lighting-networks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">http://www.nxp.com/applications/lighting/wired-lighting-networks/<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p><p>NXP microcontrollers for HABA applications<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers/application/home_and_building_automation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers/application/home_and_building_automation/<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p>",

      "content": "<p>Urban mobility is one of the biggest challenges cities are facing. 53 percent of the world&#x2019;s population live in urban areas and this percentage is likely to continue to increase in the coming&#xA0;decades. Past and current solutions will not be suitable any more in a new scenario where both technologies and user needs are subject to a continuous and speedy metamorphosis. That is why ensuring efficient mobility of people and goods is so important. The future of mobility needs to encompass a clear sustainability component, which embraces the environmental and the social needs of tomorrow.</p><p>At&#xA0;<a href=\"http://ertico.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">ERTICO<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, we believe that the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) in cities is imperative to solve mobility issues. Extending the urban infrastructure and building new roads is very expensive and difficult, especially in old and crowded European cities with very limited space. The implementation of new intelligent transport solutions on an existing infrastructure can provide consistent advantages to the cities, limiting the cost, land-take and disruption of users&#x2019; mobility that new road works could cause.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Hermann-blog.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\" wp-image-4183 alignright\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Hermann-blog-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Hermann blog\" width=\"358\" height=\"238\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Hermann-blog-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Hermann-blog-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px\"></a>However, most cities are still not prepared to tackle these mobility challenges, probably due to the lack of coordination between stakeholders when providing mobility services and the lack of a clear vision on how urban mobility systems should look like in the future. This is why cross-sectorial cooperation among public and private stakeholders is essential for overcoming the obstacles lying ahead.</p><p>There is a long way to go, but everything suggests that we are at the dawn of a new mobility revolution. Many cities in Europe are currently reconsidering their urban structure and management as well as rethinking the transport system as a network of intermodal and inter-connected services, placing the customer at its centre. The technology available for these changes includes 5G, digital broadcast, ITS G5 and cloud-based services.</p><p>The need to reduce congestion, accidents and pollution while improving the mobility of citizens, including an aging population and people with disabilities, are the driving forces of this change of thinking. Finally, the economic reasons behind the take-off of information and communication technology (ICT) in road transport refer to the fact that ITS is the cheapest and most effective way to sustain mobility.</p><p>Several years ago, ERTICO launched the &#x201C;ITS for Urban Mobility&#x201D; initiative to facilitate the dialogue between public city authorities and the industry. This initiative has now grown into the integration of cities in the ERTICO Partnership. The cities of Vigo (Spain) and Northampton (UK) have already joined, showing their commitment to release the potential of untapped ITS solutions to improve mobility back home.</p><p>Earlier this year, we also launched our six core programmes. Urban mobility is one of them. Moreover, ERTICO is supporting ITS early adopter cities in the implementation of ITS solutions. London provides a good example of open data policy, while cities such as Bordeaux, Verona, Helmond, to cite just a few, are testing services that will inform drivers about the green lights ahead so they can drive more smoothly.</p><p>The forthcoming&#xA0;<a href=\"http://itsworldcongress.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">ITS Wold Congress<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>&#xA0;in Bordeaux in October 2015 will create a perfect environment for local authorities to share their experiences and discuss structural and financial barriers. In line with this spirit, ERTICO, as Congress organisers together with the European Commission, ITS America, ITS Asia-Pacific and the local hosts, have prepared a full day dedicated to &#x201C;Sustainable Urban Mobility&#x201D;, including multiple sessions, workshops and exhibitions.</p><p>&#xA0;</p>",

There is a program that is available on most computers called traceroute that provides a list of every piece of network equipment or computer that a request would go through between your computer or phone and a website or service that you are using. &#xA0;When I run this command, I usually find several dozen pieces of equipment that my requests travel through. &#xA0;What&#x2019;s also amazing is that the time it takes a request to travel through these dozens of pieces of equipment is generally measured in hundredths of seconds.&#xA0; Each of these pieces of networking equipment includes multicore processors, sometimes many, that run networking software and are used to control the flow of Internet traffic.</p><p>ARM recently announced its vision of a future network infrastructure, called the Intelligent Flexible Cloud (IFC) based on&#xA0;diverse, scalable, highly-integrated system-on-chips (SoC) with heterogeneous compute capabilities supported by a common layer of enabling software running on multicore processor based SoCs and distributed network intelligence. &#xA0;This vision aligns closely to the vision that we have&#xA0;articulated for our QorIQ LS series multicore communications processor products.</p><p>The driving force of this new approach to networking is the constantly evolving Internet. &#xA0;Even just 10 years ago the Internet was still mostly used for reading static web pages. &#xA0;Now it is becoming the primary way we watch TV programs and movies and the way we communicate with each other with our mobile phones. In the not too distant future, we expect that most of our household appliances, automobiles and even our bodies (we call this the Internet of Tomorrow) will also be connected to and communicating over the Internet.</p><p>As the Internet has evolved into a distribution medium for commerce, entertainment, social networking, mobile applications and things generally, it is being asked to do things that were not envisioned when it was first created. &#xA0;This has led to significant ongoing capital spending to both add new capacity and also respond to new types of service requirements created by ever changing usage of the Internet.&#xA0; Companies, like AT&amp;T and Verizon, that buy a lot of the networking equipment needed to build the Internet, are now looking for more flexible solutions that, once installed, will be able to evolve and add new functions and perhaps remove old functions without necessarily needing to buy new equipment. They are also looking for equipment that will be easier to configure and operate and that can be more intelligently managed.</p><p>The Intelligent Flexible Cloud provides the approach that best meets the needs of the next generation Internet.&#xA0; IFC combines the flexibility of software in the form of software defined networking and network functions virtualization (SDN and NFV), with the cost effectiveness and performance improvements that come from the use of targeted system on chip&#xA0; (SoC) devices.&#xA0;&#xA0; The IFC steps beyond pure software approaches because pure software approaches to moving Internet data are non-optimal and inherently inefficient.&#xA0; By combining software with dedicated hardware based acceleration the IFC approach provides the optimal combination of flexibility and performance that the industry seeks.</p><p>We have anticipated the requirements for more flexible, powerful and cost effective networking equipment and has developed a new product line based on the ARM 64-bit processor architecture coupled to a powerful set of hardware acceleration built on the IFC principles.&#xA0; These new devices enable the development of next generation systems that will meet the demanding needs of the Internet of Tomorrow.</p><p><em>Image used by permission from ARM Holdings.</em></p>",

More recently (<a href=\"/sensors/mining-sensor-data-part-3-capturing-to-a-file/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Mining sensor data, Part3</a>), Maureen Helm showed the framework we are using to build the windows-based clients that actually create the log files of interest.&#xA0; My next post will followup on Maureen&#x2019;s writeup.&#xA0; But in this post, I want to again explore patterns in data.&#xA0;&#xA0; I also want to show some mistakes that can be easily made.</p><p>When I first started looking at&#xA0;sensor data analytics,&#xA0;I explored techniques to predict&#xA0;defects in rotating machinery.&#xA0; The techniques to do this are well known and documented, and there is an established industry that provides exactly this service.&#xA0; I wanted to see if I could apply supervised machine learning techniques to the problem in an attempt to expand use of the techniques into other markets.&#xA0; But over the course of the next few months, I learned a hard lesson:&#xA0; Supervised machine learning requires data, lots of it.&#xA0; I could (and did) attach sensors to lots of machinery to log &#x201C;well behavior&#x201D;.&#xA0; The problem came when it came to logging &#x201C;not-well behavior&#x201D;.&#xA0; Very few people were willing to let me run their motors to failure.&#xA0; Those of you in the motor business have a ready supply.&#xA0; I work for a semiconductor firm.&#xA0; No such luck.</p><p>Figure 1: Data is everywhere</p><p>My boss (a very wise man) suggested that I change problems.&#xA0; Why not look at kitchens?&#xA0; Start simple: boil water.&#xA0; Even I can boil water.&#xA0; Boiling water makes noise, it vibrates.&#xA0; And I can identify when water is NOT boiling, in a simmer state, or in a rolling boil.&#xA0; YEAH!&#xA0; I can easily get known states for supervised learning!</p><p>I placed an accelerometer&#xA0;near a stock pot similar to that in Figure 1.&#xA0; I also mounted one on the&#xA0;handle of the pot&#xA0;itself.&#xA0; My data logger (which Maureen covered in the last post of this series) records raw data in .csv form, as well as metadata in XML format.&#xA0; I was hoping to develop a simple model that could tell you the &#x201C;state of the pot&#x201D; based solely upon vibration data, so I used Matlab&#xAE; to&#xA0;post-process a number of features from my accelerometer measurements:</p><p>Figure 2 below shows the&#xA0;standard deviation of the vector magnitude&#xA0;taken over&#xA0;several 30 second runs.&#xA0; This looked pretty promising!</p><p>Figure 2: Standard deviation of the vector magnitude</p><p>Figure 3 shows the cross-correlation between the vertical and horizontal components of acceleration.&#xA0; Still good!</p><p>Figure 3: Cross correlation between vertical and horizontal vibrations</p><p>Crossing rates in Figure 4 aren&#x2019;t bad either.</p><p>Figure 4: Crossing rates</p><p>Now if I were to plot these three by state, I can come up with a couple of planes in the three dimensional space that would <strong><em>appear</em></strong> to clearly differentiate non-boiling from simmer from rolling boil.</p><p>Figure 5: A 3-dimensional view</p><p>BUT NOT SO FAST!&#xA0; For the data above, I treated the boiling process as if it had 3 distinct states.&#xA0; In reality, it is a continuous process, which Figure 6 clearly demonstrates.&#xA0; For that test sequence, I did a continuous log of data from cold all the way to rolling boil.</p><p>Figure 6: It&#x2019;s really a continuous process</p><p>When I looked at Figure 6, I assumed that the area indicated by the arrow was associated with rolling boil.&#xA0; BUT NOT SO FAST!</p><p>Figure 7: 10 minutes worth of data for each of 3 states</p><p>I went back to the kitchen and took three separate data sets, each over a 10 minute period of time, and at each of my three desired states.&#xA0; Figure 7 is the result.&#xA0; Rolling boil data turned out to be nicely clustered, with much more variance in the simmer state.&#xA0; What&#x2019;s that all about?</p><p>Replotting the vector magnitude versus time for the dataset used in Figure 6, I got a really interesting result, shown in Figure 8 below.</p><p>Figure 8: Vector magnitude versus time</p><p>This looks almost exactly like a figure I later found in reference [1], labeled &#x201C;Sound pressure signal of cooking process&#x201D;.&#xA0; Well, that makes sense.&#xA0; I&#x2019;m using an accelerometer to measure vibration, which is just another word for sound.&#xA0; Another way to look at the data is by computing the standard deviation of a small window moving across the dataset of Figure 8.&#xA0; This is shown in Figure 9, and you can clearly see a peak and subsequent decline to a stable value as the water goes into a rolling boil state.&#xA0; I see similar shapes in plots for Power Spectral Density (PSD)&#xA0;log energy entropy, cross correlation, log energy entropy of the raw signal, variance and range feature types.</p><p>Figure 9: Standard deviation of the vector magnitude over time</p><p>To find out why, consult Figure 10, which I&#x2019;ve borrowed from Wikipedia.&#xA0; It plots&#xA0;rate of heat transfer versus&#xA0;the temperature of the pan above the saturation temperature T<sub>s</sub>.&#xA0; The downturn in Figures 8 and 9 corresponds to the &#x201C;transition boiling&#x201D; region of Figure 10.&#xA0; In this area, we&#x2019;re just starting to see a phenomena known as &#x201C;film boiling&#x201D;.&#xA0; When this starts to occur, our system becomes less efficient at transferring heat.&#xA0; The curve levels out once film boiling dominates over nucleate boiling (which I&#x2019;ve referred to as &#x201C;simmer&#x201D;).</p><p>Figure 10: Heat transfer for water <sup>2</sup></p><p>Great!&#xA0; At this point we have data which matches known theory.&#xA0; We should be ready to model our system. BUT NOT SO FAST! Just how repeatable is this?</p><p>Figure 11: Standard deviation of the vector magnitude &#x2013; Diversified!</p><p>State dependency in Figure 11 isn&#x2019;t nearly so straight forward as we hoped in Figure 2.&#xA0; Here I&#x2019;ve included more datasets.&#xA0; I&#x2019;ve also included data from sensors located near other burners on the stove.&#xA0; These are labelled &#x201C;none&#x201D; above, because there was no pot on the adjacent burner.&#xA0; But in many cases, we still got vibration &#x2013; from the pot across the stove!</p><p>Things are not so pretty any more.&#xA0; Plots for cross correlation and crossing rates show similar overlap between states.</p><p>So what have we learned?</p><p>I&#x2019;m not done with this problem just yet.&#xA0; I am seeing some data signatures that should help me differentiate between burners on a stove top.&#xA0; And I need to find the most robust method to identify the entry to the&#xA0;transition boiling region.&#xA0; And don&#x2019;t even ask me about spaghetti sauce!</p><p><strong>Afterward</strong></p><p>After submitting my initial draft of this post, I went back to a&#xA0;slightly revised version of&#xA0;Figures 8 and 9.&#xA0; I then computed a moving average of the standard deviation.&#xA0; The three are combined in Figure 12.</p><p>Figure 12: Raw data, standard deviation and moving average of the standard deviation</p><p>The black line is the moving average (100 samples) of the standard deviation (each in turn computed using 64 samples of the original data).&#xA0; You might wonder about the cyclic signal that seems to be superimposed on it in the &#x201C;simmer region&#x201D;.&#xA0; I did too.&#xA0; Then I thought back and remembered that my stove cycled power to the burner on and off 2 to 3 times a minute during parts of my data collection.&#xA0; That appears to correlate with what we are seeing here.&#xA0; So just using a 3-axis accelerometer, we&#x2019;ve been able to tease out when water starts to simmer, enters transition boiling, goes into full rolling boil, AND the cycling period of the stove it was heated on.</p><p>&#xA0;</p>",

      "content": "<p>Our world is full of technological marvels that have enhanced many aspects of our lives. The unabated rise of the smartphone app in almost every aspect of modern life is also well understood. However our homes &#x2018;operate&#x2019; in much the same way they did through most of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, despite the availability of connected hardware such as <a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/applications/lighting/wireless-lighting-networks/smart-lighting.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">lamps<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, thermostats, locks, etc.</p><p>The uptake of home automation systems has been partly inhibited by the need for wired systems &#x2013; a costly solution that also causes a lot of disruption during installation. Now, we don&#x2019;t need wires. &#x2018;Disruption-free&#x2019; wireless technology is available as a globally acceptable standard and at low cost. While home automation systems can be complex to run, smartphones or tablets with their intuitive graphical interface provide a ready-made way to interact easily and conveniently with all devices.</p><p>Over the years there have been numerous competing connectivity protocol options. In a recent paper presented at embedded world &#x2013; The Internet of Things in the home using ZigBee Home Automation &#x2013; we demonstrated how <a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/techzones/wireless-connectivity/home-automation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">ZigBee Home Automation (HA)<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> could provide the standardized, secure connectivity and application functionality within the home.</p><p>For most domestic applications the default commissioning method could be similar to the push button method used to add WiFi devices to a router. However for more secure applications or devices with limited or non-existent user interfaces, such as sensors or light bulbs, the network key, PANID, radio channel and potentially device configuration can be loaded into the <a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/documents/brochure/75017587.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">device via NFC transfer<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>.</p><p>This brings additional benefits, in that commissioning can be controlled from a graphical user interface on a NFC enabled smartphone or tablet. New devices wishing to join can be viewed on a screen and the relevant ones accepted onto the network. Once the device has received the network key, it can fully participate in the network and can be bound to other devices to set up control relationships as required by the user.<a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ZigBee_Home_Automation-2.jpg.png\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4174\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ZigBee_Home_Automation-2.jpg-1024x366.png\" alt=\"ZigBee_Home_Automation 2.jpg\" width=\"568\" height=\"203\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ZigBee_Home_Automation-2.jpg-1024x366.png 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ZigBee_Home_Automation-2.jpg-300x107.png 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ZigBee_Home_Automation-2.jpg.png 1079w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px\"></a></p><p>Connecting the home to the internet allows the development of new and novel services. However connecting ZigBee networks to the internet requires additional functionality to translate between ZigBee and internet protocols. For example, commands from home automation application interfaces such as Apple&#x2019;s &#x2018;Homekit&#x2019;, and &#x2018;Alljoyn&#x2019; from the Allseen Alliance &#x2013; must be translated into ZigBee&#x2019;s commands and addresses in a gateway device.</p><p>Using a layered approach to the software in a gateway brings numerous benefits; a ZigBee virtual machine layer can translate from an external application layer protocol to ZigBee. Similar approaches can be used to connect multiple devices using different network layers.</p>",

The next step in mining sensor data is the subject of today&#x2019;s blog &#x2013; capturing raw sensor data and metadata to a file. This will allow us to experiment with signal processing and machine learning algorithms later.</p><p>Our embedded sensor application handles configuring the accelerometer device and sampling raw accelerometer data on a periodic interval by making use of ISF&#x2019;s I2C driver, bus manager (timer), and sensor adapter components. It also provides a well-defined serial communication protocol for a host device, in this case a PC, to receive raw sensor data using ISF&#x2019;s command interpreter component. <a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/files/32bit/doc/user_guide/OPENSDAUG.pdf\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">OpenSDA<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> provides a serial-to-USB adapter to bridge communications with our PC.</p><p>Now that we have everything configured on the embedded side, we need something on the PC to communicate with the serial port and log data to a file. A serial terminal application, such as <a href=\"http://realterm.sourceforge.net/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">RealTerm<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, is always useful for an initial test to make sure you can open/close the port, send a command, and receive a response. Most serial terminals can also log to a file, but this is not enough for our mining sensor data application&#x2026;we need metadata!</p><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Metadata<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> is &#x201C;data about data&#x201D;. We want to capture the conditions under which the raw sensor data was collected. For example, in an intelligent stove top we want to detect if water in a pot is boiling. In addition to the raw sensor data, we&#x2019;d like to know:</p><p>We have too many parameters to try to encapsulate them in a complicated filename, so instead we can capture them in an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">XML<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> file and bundle it with the raw sensor data files in a .zip. To automate this process, we developed our own PC application using Microsoft Visual Studio and <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zw4w595w.aspx\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">.NET Framework<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>. The .NET Framework&#x2019;s support for <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/182eeyhh%28v=vs.110%29.aspx\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">XML serialization<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> is particularly useful.</p><p><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/StoveTopLogger.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12009 size-full\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/StoveTopLogger.jpg\" alt=\"StoveTopLogger\" width=\"1029\" height=\"583\"></a></p><p>Now, when I want to log data, all I have to do is fill in the various fields and click &#x201C;Record&#x201D;. The user interface makes use of combo boxes to prevent invalid values from polluting the metadata. In the above figure, I&#x2019;ve decided to monitor a stock pot filled with boiling water on the front right burner, which I&#x2019;ve named Burner A. I want to see the difference between mounting a sensor on the pot handle vs. mounting a sensor on the stove top, therefore I&#x2019;ve configured two sensor boards to record simultaneously.</p><p>The result is a .zip file containing the raw sensor data in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">CSV<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> format and the metadata in XML format.</p><p><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/WinZip.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12010\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/WinZip.jpg\" alt=\"WinZip\" width=\"1045\" height=\"471\"></a></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>And finally, here&#x2019;s an excerpt from the XML file:</p><p>An intelligent stove top is just one example of the many IoT applications that arise from mining sensor data. At the start of all of these applications is a need to capture raw sensor data and metadata in a variety of known conditions. With this in mind, we architected our PC application to contain reusable base classes that implement the data flow, and derived classes that implement stove-top-specific behavior. All that changes from one application to the next is the metadata; the methods to communicate with ISF, write raw sensor data to a CSV file, write metadata to an XML file, etc. are all the same. As a result, it is easy to re-spin our stove top logger into a human fall logger, a sump pump logger, or &#x2026;.</p><p>Stay tuned for the next entry in our Mining Sensor Data blog series, where Mike Stanley will import our raw sensor data and metadata into Matlab, and use it to train machine learning algorithms.</p>",

These increasingly powerful and interconnected experiences cannot be allowed to mean short battery life or high cost to deliver.</p><p>Design engineers in long lead-time industries such as automotive, embedded, industrial, enterprise networking, servers and medical devices in particular face important decisions as they seek to provide that balance of performance and efficiency.&#xA0; It can take years for an automotive company to design and deploy a cutting edge Infotainment or digital cluster design into the market.&#xA0;&#xA0; As microprocessor architectures evolve rapidly it is critical that solutions which enhance performance <em>and </em>efficiency be available well in advance.</p><p>It seems like only yesterday we were discussing designing for the future and how to get the most from our top of the line i.MX applications processors with ARMv7 architecture (based on the 32-bit ARM&#xAE; Cortex&#xAE;-A8 and &#x2013;A9 cores).&#xA0; Freescale is preparing for tomorrow&#x2019;s need today with a new generation of i.MX processors based on the ARMv8 architecture.&#xA0; With <a href=\"http://www.arm.com/about/newsroom/arm-expects-vehicle-compute-performance-to-increase-100x-in-next-decade.php\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">ARM&#x2019;s recent introduction of the 64-bit Cortex-A72 core<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, a critical piece of that new generation is in place.</p><p>In addition to the raw specs, which are impressive enough, there are several reasons the Cortex-A72 is compelling to Freescale and our customers:</p><p>It seems that stringent market demands always arrive sooner than expected.&#xA0; The time to anticipate the future is now, in order to capture the imaginations and experiences of tomorrow&#x2019;s customers.&#xA0; The transition from a 32-bit world to a 64-bit one is a natural step, made easier by the Cortex-A72 and one to be taken sooner, rather than later.</p><p><em><strong>Contributed by&#xA0;Kyle Fox, i.MX Product Line Manager and&#xA0;Dan Loop,&#xA0;i.MX Automotive Business Development</strong></em></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p>",

I attend conferences on cyber issues, discuss the importance of protecting data and improving authentication algorithms, and highlight the ways NXP&#x2019;s technologies can make it safer to go online.</p><p>But online security recently became very personal.<img class=\" wp-image-4101 size-medium alignright\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_1848-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1848\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_1848-225x300.jpg 225w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_1848-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_1848.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\"> A few weeks ago, I got a letter from health-insurance provider, Anthem, telling me there&#x2019;s a chance my account was compromised.

My name, birthday, Social Security number, and employment data &#x2013; including income &#x2013; could be in criminal hands.</p><p>The experience has made me even more alert to security issues, and the many ways companies are working to make us safer. The <a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/news/news-archive/2015/RSA-security-conference.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">RSA Conference,<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> happening this week in San Francisco, brings many of these issues to the forefront.</p><p>In the run-up to the show, one announcement in particular caught my attention, regarding Samsung&#x2019;s data-exchange platform, known as <a href=\"http://www.voiceofthebody.io/simband/simband-documentation/simband-sami.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">SAMI,<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> and how it interacts with their new wearable device, called <a href=\"https://blog.samsungsami.io/development/simband/2015/02/17/Simband-talks-to-SAMI.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Simband<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>. The Simband wristband uses multiple sensors to monitor vital signs, and supports remote access to the user&#x2019;s data.</p><p>To protect the Simband device and the user data it collects, Samsung has developed the SAMI (SAMsung Infrastructure) <a href=\"https://blog.samsungsami.io/development/security/simband/2015/04/02/keeping-devices-and-data-secure-in-sami.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Secure Device Registration<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> feature.

The authentication process leverages the unique features provided by the specific cryptographic curves that are supported by the NXP chip before a token is distributed to the wearable device and further used to enable every communication with SAMI cloud services.</p><p>The secure element is arguably one of the most important parts of the Samsung process, since it&#x2019;s what ensures the client&#x2019;s private key, used in the SSL handshake, remains private. The secure element enables a level of protection simply not possible with a software-only solution.</p><p>Acting as vaults for private data, secure elements are, in many ways, the foundation for strong authentication, and they&#x2019;re being designed into a wide range of security-related applications. At the RSA Conference, my NXP colleagues will be demoing the secure element used in the Simband device and elsewhere. They&#x2019;ll also be showing how <a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/applications/cyber-security/cloud-security.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">FIDO authentication<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, with secure elements, supports <a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/solutions/portable-wearable/mobile.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">mobile security<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> and logical/physical access to cloud-based applications, and demonstrating designs that make the <a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/secure-connections/internet-of-things.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Internet of Things (IoT)<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> a safer place.</p><p>With the recent Anthem breach still very much on my mind, it&#x2019;s encouraging, and to a certain degree comforting, to see the ways that Samsung and other companies are using NXP&#x2019;s secure elements to increase the security of online access.<a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Security-3.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4103\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Security-3-1024x341.jpg\" alt=\"Security 3\" width=\"610\" height=\"203\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Security-3-1024x341.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Security-3-300x100.jpg 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Security-3.jpg 1875w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\"></a></p><p><em>Samsung blog on SAMI and Simband<br>\n</em><a href=\"https://blog.samsungsami.io/development/security/simband/2015/04/02/keeping-devices-and-data-secure-in-sami.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">https://blog.samsungsami.io/development/security/simband/2015/04/02/keeping-devices-and-data-secure-in-sami.html<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p><p><em>NXP TechZone site for secure elements<br>\n</em><a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/techzones/nfc-zone/technology/secure-element.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">http://www.nxp.com/techzones/nfc-zone/technology/secure-element.html<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p>",

At work, for example, when I meet with colleagues, the lights turn on as soon as we enter the conference room, and turn off again after we leave. I&#x2019;ve also been in buildings that automatically close heat registers at the end of the business day, and others that use sensors to lower blinds when the sun is at its brightest, or turn on the air conditioning when the outdoor temperature hits a certain point. These automated features save energy while making the workplace more comfortable and more productive.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Chicago.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4094\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Chicago-1024x452.jpg\" alt=\"Chicago night panorama\" width=\"610\" height=\"269\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Chicago-1024x452.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Chicago-300x133.jpg 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Chicago-960x425.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\"></a></p><p>The growing use of automation in new and reconstructed commercial buildings is due, in large part, to the push for greener, more energy-efficient construction. In California, it&#x2019;s now mandatory that commercial buildings comply with <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.energy.ca.gov/title24/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Title 24<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></span>, which calls for automated lighting, heating, and cooling functions. Many states have opted to follow the California guidelines, while others have chosen to use the recommendations of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.ashrae.org/resources--publications/bookstore/standard-90-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">ASHRAE 90.1<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></span>, a set of minimum requirements for energy-efficient buildings, published by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers, in Atlanta.</p><p>Both standards recommend the use of technology, such as sensors and wired or wireless connectivity, to save energy while enhancing work environments. Sensors help regulate operation by monitoring things like motion, temperature, and light levels, and connectivity makes it possible for devices to communicate with each other and the control network. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/applications/lighting/wired-lighting-networks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Wired connectivity<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></span>, in the form of DALI, DMX512, and KNX networks, is a popular choice for automated lighting systems, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.techzones/wireless-connectivity/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">wireless protocols<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></span>, such as WiFi, Bluetooth, and ZigBee, make the installation, deployment, and operation of sensor-equipped devices just that much easier.</p><p>What I&#x2019;ve noticed is that the techniques specified by standards like Title 24 and ASHARE 90.1 are influencing more than just commercial buildings. I think it&#x2019;s because when people have the experience of working in automated environments, they&#x2019;re more likely to start wanting similar levels of comfort, convenience, and even productivity at home, too. More and more people are installing automated appliances, such as thermostats that learn preferences, sensor-controlled lights, and window shades that can be controlled with a smartphone.<a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/FutureofBuildingAutomation.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4053\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/FutureofBuildingAutomation.jpg\" alt=\"FutureofBuildingAutomation\" width=\"490\" height=\"413\"></a>Home and building automation (HABA) is a segment of the Internet of Things (IoT), and, as such, is a pretty hot topic these days. A growing number of companies are making building-automation products available for the home market &#x2013; just walk into your local do-it-yourself store or electronics warehouse, and you&#x2019;ll find lots of options. Most these options had their start in commercial environments.</p><p>We&#x2019;re still in the early days of smart home devices, but it won&#x2019;t be long before our homes really live up to the name &#x201C;smart,&#x201D; using automation to make life easier, more efficient, and more enjoyable. Pretty soon, I&#x2019;ll walk into my living room, and the room will know it&#x2019;s me. The lights will immediately set to the combination I like best &#x2013; with just the right level of brightness and color rendering &#x2013; my favorite music will start playing, and the room temperature will adjust to match my level of activity. All these things are possible today. What&#x2019;s needed now is a bit of ingenuity to make the technologies work together, for a seamless user experience &#x2013; at work or at home.</p><p>TechZone page for wireless connectivity<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/techzones/wireless-connectivity/overview.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">http://www.nxp.com/techzones/wireless-connectivity/overview.html<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p><p>NXP&#x2019;s ZigBee home automation guide<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/documents/user_manual/JN-UG-3076.pdf\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">http://www.nxp.com/documents/user_manual/JN-UG-3076.pdf<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p><p>NXP Bluetooth Smart connectivity<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers/key_feature/bluetooth/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers/key_feature/bluetooth/<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p><p>NXP solutions for wired lighting networks<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/applications/lighting/wired-lighting-networks/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">http://www.nxp.com/applications/lighting/wired-lighting-networks/<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p><p>NXP microcontrollers for HABA applications<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers/application/home_and_building_automation/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers/application/home_and_building_automation/<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p>",

This project is preconfigured and would allow you to follow along as we explain the steps to build this embedded application.</p><p>As with most Kinetis MCU projects, we start by launching the Kinetis Design Studio (KDS).&#xA0; I&#x2019;m using KDS 2.0 for this example.&#xA0; I also assume that ISF 2.1 has been installed in the standard directory on my local machine and the PEupd file for ISF 2.1 has been imported into the Processor Expert Component Library (the PEupd file is a collection of Processor Expert technology components in a format for easy import into the Component Library).</p><h3>Creating the KDS 2.0 Workspace and Project</h3><p>For this example, the target is a FRDM-K64F development board.&#xA0; The FRDM-K64F contains an on-board FXOS8700CQ 6-Axis Combo Accelerometer/Magnetometer which we will use for measuring acceleration.</p><p>First I create a workspace directly inside the Example Apps directory of ISF 2.1 and browse and import the ISF_K64F_KDS_PROJ example application into the workspace.</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-1-Import-Projects.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11938 size-full\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-1-Import-Projects.jpg\" alt=\"Image #1 Import Projects\" width=\"882\" height=\"504\"></a></p><h3>Configuring the Processor Expert Components and Generating the Code</h3><p>At this point, we begin using the ISF Processor Expert components to build the structures for the embedded application.&#xA0; We add the ISF_Core component from the Processor Expert Component Library to the project.&#xA0; We need means to communicate to the Host PC and to the I2C sensors.&#xA0; This is done by configuring the CommChannelConfig1 component which is underneath ISF_Core (this component was automatically inherited by ISF_Core) to add I2C_CH1 (sensors) and UART_CH1 (host).</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-2-Comm-Channel.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11937 size-full\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-2-Comm-Channel.jpg\" alt=\"Image #2 Comm Channel\" width=\"938\" height=\"201\"></a></p><p>At a sample rate of 800 Hz, we need to bump up the baud rate on the serial interface to 230400.</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-3-Properties.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11936\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-3-Properties.jpg\" alt=\"Image #3 Properties\" width=\"812\" height=\"510\"></a></p><p>Since we are using the on-board FXOS8700CQ, we need to change the I2C configuration slightly to use I2C Channel I2C0, SDA pin PTE25, and SCL pin PTE24.</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-4-More-Properties.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11935\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-4-More-Properties.jpg\" alt=\"Image #4 More Properties\" width=\"921\" height=\"473\"></a></p><p>Back to the ISF_Core, we need an accelerometer to measure vibration.&#xA0; Change the System Sensor Configuration to add the FXOS8700CQ as the only sensor.&#xA0; We will use the accelerometer from this combo Accelerometer/Magnetometer device.&#xA0; The toolwill ask you for a Comm Channel, so select I2C_CH1.</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-5-System-Sensor-Config.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11934\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-5-System-Sensor-Config.jpg\" alt=\"Image #5 System Sensor Config\" width=\"924\" height=\"207\"></a></p><p>Also, we need to modify the Device Address for the FXOS8700_1 component (inside Referenced_Component) to 0x1D.</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-6-Device-Access.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11933\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-6-Device-Access.jpg\" alt=\"Image #6 Device Access\" width=\"888\" height=\"100\"></a></p><p>We now have the ISF Core configured, but we need to add an Embedded Application environment.&#xA0; We get this by adding the ISFEmbApp component from the PEx Component Library into the project.</p><p>In the ISFEmbApp, change the Initial State to STARTED_SUBSCRIBED, which causes the embedded application to initialize the sensors and begin collecting raw sensor data immediately upon startup.</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-7-Main-App-Settings.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11932\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-7-Main-App-Settings.jpg\" alt=\"Image #7 Main App Settings\" width=\"952\" height=\"254\"></a></p><p>Then in the Subscription List tab, add a subscription to the FXOS87000 for Fixed Point, Raw Acceleration 3D data at 800 Hz (1250 &#xB5;sec).&#xA0; This provides high speed raw accelerometer samples across three axes (X,Y,Z) in a 32-bit fixed point generic data format for the host PC to log.</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-8-Subscription-List.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11931\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-8-Subscription-List.jpg\" alt=\"Image #8 Subscription List\" width=\"924\" height=\"257\"></a></p><p>We now can receive the raw sensor data, but we want to do some customization of the embedded application, so we need to add the hooks to do that.&#xA0; Access the Host Interface tab and add three User Defined Host Commands and number them 7, 8, and 9.&#xA0; These will be attached to custom subroutines below.</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-9-Host-Interface.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11930\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-9-Host-Interface.jpg\" alt=\"Image #9 Host Interface\" width=\"910\" height=\"289\"></a></p><p>Finally, we also want to use Processor Expert components to set up the RGB LEDs on the FRDM-K64F development board.&#xA0; These interfaces use the BitIO_LDD from the Processor Expert Component Library.&#xA0; We add three of these components to the project and configure them.</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-10-Properties.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11929\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-10-Properties.jpg\" alt=\"Image #10 Properties\" width=\"694\" height=\"311\"></a></p><p>LED_RED uses PTB22 (Port B, Pin 22), which LED_GREEN uses PTE26 and LED_BLUE uses PTB21.&#xA0; Also, make sure to set the Auto Initialization property to &#x201C;yes&#x201D;.</p><p>We are now ready to generate the code.&#xA0; Select the &#x201C;Generate Processor Expert Code&#x201D; icon.</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-11-Components-Screen.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11928\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-11-Components-Screen.jpg\" alt=\"Image #11 Components Screen\" width=\"463\" height=\"423\"></a></p><h3>Attaching Custom User Code to the Generated Code inside Project</h3><p>Once we have generated the ISF Embedded Application Framework, we can attach our application code to the generated code in order to respond to the Host Interface commands that we have defined and to attach functionality associated with each raw sample.&#xA0; In general, Processor Expert technology provides user defined function &#x201C;landing pads&#x201D; for this purpose.&#xA0; One example a &#x201C;landing pad&#x201D; is the App1_ProcessData function inside App1_Functions.c below</p><p>While the function itself is generated by the tool, the code inside the function (after /******Write your code here*******/) can be modified by the user and will be preserved during subsequent code generation.</p><p>For the Embedded Data Logger, we&#x2019;ve added our user code in /Sources/sensor_data_logger.c and .h files.&#xA0; The Embedded Data Logger makes use of the Embedded Application main loop &#x201C;landing pads&#x201D; to support tailored processing of the raw sensor data.&#xA0; These areas are generated in the main loop inside /Generated_Code/App1.c which in turn call functions supplied by the user in /Sources/App1_Functions.c.&#xA0; The Embedded Data Logger inserts calls into these functions as follows:</p><p>The sensor_data_logger_init function sets up the Accelerometer data limits (MIN/MAX) and the length of the duty_cycle for flashing the LED to indicate activity.</p><p>The sensor_data_logger_process function applies the MIN/MAX limits on the accelerometer data and then cycles the LED on/off as the activity indicator.</p><p>Inside /Sources/Events.c the three custom Host Command Interface (HCI) function are modified as follows:</p><p>sensor_data_logger_connection_test_on/off simply turn on and off the green LED on the FRDM-K46F Freedom development board.&#xA0; This allows the user to easily identify one of several boards in a test setup to ensure that the logging designation corresponds to the correct position on the Embedded.</p><p>Sensor_data_logger_get_property returns a packet with a string of the properties that describes the embedded app version, target board identifier, and sensor identifier.</p><p>After these modifications are complete, the resulting embedded application project can be compiled and loaded on to the FRDM-K64F Freedom development board.&#xA0; Debugging and integration with the PC application can proceed in a normal fashion.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>ISF 2.1 allows the user to quickly develop the embedded application frameworks for useful sensor data applications.&#xA0; This allows our customers to spend time on creating useful application for the raw sensor data instead of spending time just trying to get the raw sensor data for their application. The Embedded Data Logger is a good example of how the features of ISF can be used for these types of applications.</p><p>In the next blog in this series, my colleague Maureen Helm will explain how the Windows PC host application captures raw sensor data and experiment metadata to a file in order to provide the upstream files for Sensor Data Analytics.</p><p><em>&#xA0;</em></p>",

      "url": "https://blog.nxp.com/smart-home/control-security/will-iot-devices-with-bluetooth-mesh-make-the-cut-in-home-automation",
      "content": "<p>Last summer, the home-improvement giant, Lowe&#x2019;s, took a <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/alanek/lowes-2014-smart-home-survey-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">poll<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>. They asked more than 2,000 Americans how they felt about home automation. More than fifty percent of respondents said that having a smart home was at least &#x201C;somewhat important&#x201D; to them. And, when asked what kinds of things they might automate, the most popular answers showed that people want home-automation devices that make them feel safer, make their lives easier, and help them save on their energy bills.</p><p>The good news is that the average consumer already has lots of home-automation options to choose from. But we&#x2019;re still in the early stages of this trend, and not everyone can say why they need a smart home, or why a smart home will make life easier. Early adopters, full of enthusiasm for the latest innovations, may have already taken the plunge, but others are moving more slowly. There are still plenty of people who are watching and waiting, biding their time until the user experience is truly seamless.</p><p>It&#x2019;s easy enough to understand. Changing standards and evolving technologies make it hard to commit to a particular format (we all know what happened when BetaMax went up against VHS). People can be discouraged when they realize that they may have several different technologies in play &#x2013; one for the thermostat, another for the lighting network &#x2013; and separate smartphone apps to control each one. Add in the amount of time required to configure it all, and you&#x2019;re likely to end up with one frustrated homeowner.</p><p>But there&#x2019;s one thing that homeowners can be pretty certain about: the technologies that are most likely to last are the ones that combine interoperability, power efficiency, and security. When it comes to the Internet of Things (IoT), people will choose the devices that hit the sweet spot of being easy to use and personalize, and with the right levels of security.<a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/NXP-image.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4062 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/NXP-image-300x279.jpg\" alt=\"NXP image\" width=\"300\" height=\"279\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/NXP-image-300x279.jpg 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/NXP-image.jpg 538w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"></a></p><p>Since its release in 2010, Bluetooth Version 4.0 has given rise to billions of Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE) devices on the market. Bluetooth is already a de facto standard in most smartphone interfaces, and we can expect it to remain a prominent technology in smartphones as they evolve. The arrival of mesh-compatible Bluetooth makes things even more interesting.</p><p>Mesh networks are cool because they really live up to the name &#x201C;wireless.&#x201D; Unlike most traditional &#x201C;wireless&#x201D; networks, a mesh network needs only one node to be physically wired to the Internet. The rest of the devices share that one Internet connection, since each node can also act as a router. There&#x2019;s no need for a central hub, and devices can choose the quickest, safest path for communication.</p><p>Thanks to our recent <a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/news/press-releases/2014/11/nxp-semiconductors-acquires-wearable-and-bluetooth-low-energy-ic-business-of-quintic.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">acquisition of Quintic&#x2019;s BTLE and wearable business<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, we have added low-power mesh compatibility to our Bluetooth Smart portfolio. Unlike other mesh technologies, which use flooding, a technique which can generate broadcast storms and increase energy consumption, our low-power solution fully synchronizes and routes protocols for efficient end-to-end connection between nodes. The result is an order-of-magnitude improvement on energy efficiency for the whole network. Our solution also features enhanced security, self-constructed networks with seal-healing capability, and a future-proof layered architecture, which is designed to work with standard Bluetooth Smart devices and supports over-the-air (OTA) updates for upgrading the network after deployment.</p><p><em>NXP&#x2019;s mesh capability in Bluetooth</em></p><p>Surveys like the one conducted by Lowe&#x2019;s last summer make it clear that people are interested in home automation, but there&#x2019;s still work to be done to make this a lasting trend. Devices are getting smarter and more connected, but they still need to be grounded in the user experience to be viable. And we believe mesh-compatible Bluetooth is one of the ways to get there.</p><p><em>NXP&#x2019;s TechZone site for wireless connectivity<br>\n</em><a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/techzones/wireless-connectivity/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">http://www.nxp.com/techzones/wireless-connectivity/overview.html<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p><p><em>NXP&#x2019;s portfolio for Bluetooth Smart connectivity<br>\n</em><a href=\"http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers/key_feature/bluetooth/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers/key_feature/bluetooth/<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p>",

It would be true to say that sometimes,&#xA0;for urban inhabitants, technology companies know more about, and have more influence on, consumer&#x2019;s lives than any government or state organisation.</p><p>As our cities become &#x2018;smarter&#x2019;, with connected infrastructure and digitised services, this trend will only increase. Technology will become increasingly&#xA0;pervasive but at the same time, more invisible. Surveillance, mobile sensors, smart meters, wearables, social media all collect personal information on us,&#xA0;allowing technology companies to build detailed profiles of our lives.</p><p>The interactions we have, what decisions we take and which other people we are connected with &#x2013; essentially the full spectrum of possible human to human&#xA0;and human to machine interactions are recorded by our devices and online services.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Smart-City.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-3916\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Smart-City-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Smart City\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Smart-City-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Smart-City-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Smart-City.jpg 1697w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"></a>Even with the positive benefits these technologies provide to citizens and the enthusiasm with which they are adopted, every new technology &#x201C;solution&#x201D; &#x2013; especially one considered to be disruptive &#x2013; faces a techno-political dilemma.</p><p>Issues of security, privacy and regulation come embedded in all of the many&#xA0;possible uses, intended or otherwise, of the technology itself.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Such hurdles often arise due to the pace at which technology evolves, versus the speed at which government is able to legislate; you can&#x2019;t regulate what you&#xA0;do not know. Private enterprise and governments also have two very different approaches to initiating change. Commercial technology companies have&#xA0;traditionally worked in strict secrecy to protect their precious patents and often only unveiling their solution when they are ready to bring it to market.</p><p>Governments &#x2013; in democratic societies at least &#x2013; have an entirely different approach to innovation. Collaboration, consultation and openness are important&#xA0;elements of any new project that has the potential to affect the lives of city residents.</p><p>This constant push-and-pull relationship between technology innovators and government leads to friction and ultimately it is those who have the most to gain&#xA0;&#x2013; the citizens &#x2013; that suffer as a consequence. Projects do not get off the ground, are dramatically affected by new regulation or are forced to be pulled&#xA0;entirely after already entering the public market.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>So the core question is: How can companies and municipal government representatives work together at a very early stage to establish a joint and combined&#xA0;approach?&#xA0;Part of what needs to happen is a mind-shift change on the part of technology innovators, thinking about themselves not just as solution providers but as&#xA0;political actors in the shaping of modern cities.</p><p>With this new mind-set they will be able to enter a deliberative process where the outcomes are joint strategies and memorandums which include all the&#xA0;technological and social aspects of the new solution. This is in stark contrast to the typical scenario of product or solution pitching, which the industry has&#xA0;become accustomed to.</p><p>In the same process, governments can think about how to create hybrid spaces for dialogues around large projects, like the deployment of smart transport&#xA0;infrastructure, with all relevant parties included in the process including technology providers. The earlier this is able to happen and the more knowledge and&#xA0;information that is shared the better the working relationship will be and the better our cities will be able to evolve.</p>",

      "content": "<p>A recent <a href=\"http://ipsosglobaltrends.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">study<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, conducted by the international research firm Ipsos, polled more than 16,000 people in 20 countries and uncovered some interesting things about how we, as consumers, make our purchasing decisions. It turns out that the things we traditionally associate with a particular brand, such as style, quality, and reputation, still matter, but what matters even more is how we think and feel when we interact with a brand.</p><p>The opinions we form at key points &#x2013; when we ask for information, verify authenticity, make a purchase, request a service, or actually use the product &#x2013; determine whether or not we&#x2019;ll continue our relationship with a given brand. Add to this the fact that we now have the ability to share our brand perceptions with everyone else, through social media, and each consumer is more than just one person buying a product: they&#x2019;re a reviewer and critic, with the ability to influence others.</p><p>The results of the Ipsos study underscore how important it is for brand marketers to create positive, engaging consumer experiences that turn shoppers into buyers and loyal brand ambassadors. Since the average consumer spends more and more time engaging with their smartphone, it makes sense to use the smartphone as the entry point for these experiences. And now, with more smartphones offering Near Field Communication (NFC) as a standard feature, companies can start using NFC to deliver better brand interactions at every point, whether it&#x2019;s before, at, or after the purchase. Here&#x2019;s a sample scenario, to show how this can work:<a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/NFC_Infographic.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4066\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/NFC_Infographic-1024x711.jpg\" alt=\"NFC_Infographic\" width=\"610\" height=\"424\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/NFC_Infographic-1024x711.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/NFC_Infographic-300x208.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\"></a></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>The physical product &#x2013; a dress, a bottle of wine, whatever &#x2013; has an NFC tag on it. Each tag carries a unique identifier, giving the product its own digital identity. Any and all information relating to the product can then be tied to the unique identifier.</p><p>The consumer taps the tag with a smartphone to initiate an action. The action can vary depending on the need: get information, find offers and promotions, read reviews on social media, verify product authenticity, register a purchase, receive customer rewards, view warranties, and so on.</p><p>The smartphone&#x2019;s browser hits a cloud-based platform that tells the phone where to go, based on the tag&#x2019;s unique identifier. At the same time, information about the NFC interaction is captured by the cloud&#x2019;s intelligent service. Depending on the configuration, the cloud platform can log details of the interaction, such as the location, time/date, user type, and unique phone ID. Also, depending on what the consumer decides to share, personal data, such as profiles or interests, can get captured and logged.</p><p>Stay tuned for part 2, giving examples and reasons for using NFC tags.</p>",

      "content": "<p>In &#x201C;Mining sensor data, Part 1&#x201D;, we continued our discussion on Sensor Data Analytics.&#xA0; I gave you a couple examples of how defects in a rotating machine might manifest in the machine vibration&#x2019;s&#xA0;FFT signature.&#xA0;&#xA0; We briefly looked at the effects of motor shaft misalignment and bearing defects.&#xA0; In this post, I want to look at gears.</p><p>Figure 1: Gears Animation <sup>1</sup></p><p>If we stop the animation of the&#xA0;two gear system animated in Figure 1, we can count the teeth on each gear.&#xA0; As shown in Figure 2, gear A has 10 teeth and gear B has 28.</p><p>Figure 2: Redrawn Gears have 10 and 28 teeth</p><p>Let&#x2019;s say that gear A is driven at f<sub>A</sub> = 10 Hz (or revolutions/second).&#xA0; Then the GMF (Gear Mesh Frequency) will be 10&#xA0;X 10&#xA0;= 100&#xA0;Hz.&#xA0; We can then take that 100 Hz and divide by 28 teeth/revolution for gear B&#xA0;and we have f<sub>B</sub> =&#xA0;3.57 Hz.&#xA0; If we attach an accelerometer to Machine &#x201C;M&#x201D; and look at an FFT of the output, we can expect to see peaks at 10 Hz, 100 Hz and 3.57 Hz.&#xA0; We&#x2019;ll often&#xA0;also see harmonics of those frequencies in the spectrum. Now suppose you have a fault on one of the teeth on gear B.&#xA0; This can cause spikes in the time domain at the gear B rotational frequency.&#xA0; These may manifest as +/- f<sub>B</sub> sidebands on the 100 Hz&#xA0;GMF peak in the frequency domain.&#xA0; Sometimes&#xA0;the FFT sidebands may be distorted by the physical transmission path between gears and sensor,&#xA0;and it may be easier to see the defect in the time domain.</p><p>We have&#xA0;a relationship with the <a href=\"http://enpub.fulton.asu.edu/sensip/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Arizona State University Sensor, Signal &amp; Information Processing (SenSIP) Center <span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>in Tempe, Arizona.&#xA0; We&#x2019;ve been sponsoring a project with SenSIP to explore how we might simplify machine learning for condition monitoring of machinery.&#xA0; I&#x2019;ll touch more on machine learning in a later post.&#xA0; But right now I would like to expand the&#xA0;case above into a real world example.&#xA0; If you routinely read my blogs, you may recall a posting from last December entitled <a href=\"/sensors/when-prototyping-think-maker/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">When prototyping, think &#x201C;Maker&#x201D;</a>.&#xA0; That posting outlined the evolution of the&#xA0;test setup in Figure 3.</p><p>Figure&#xA0;3: Third Generation Motor Vibration Test Setup</p><p>The motor in the setup includes a 4 gear gearbox. &#xA0;We gave one of these to Mr. Jongmin Lee, who is currently pursuing his PhD at ASU, and asked him to go crazy.&#xA0; He loaded the motor with a crude friction load, and ran it to failure (see Figure 4).&#xA0; Along the way, he took vibration data to determine if we could see differences over time.</p><p>Figure 4: After much abuse by Jongmin</p><p>Figure 5 shows the power spectral density for measured vibrations early in the&#xA0;life of the motor.&#xA0; If you click on the figure, the expanded version will clearly show various frequency peaks that Jongmin has been able to relate to the motor, gear, and gear mesh frequencies (with 4 gears, there are a lot of frequencies of interest).</p><p>Figure 5: Initial Power Spectral Density</p><p>In Figure 6, he&#x2019;s layered on the PSD as measured soon before motor failure.&#xA0; You can see some obvious changes in the spectrum.</p><p>Figure 6: Adding PSD shortly before motor failure</p><p>We can also look at raw data in the time domain.&#xA0; Looking at Figures 7 through 9, you can tell that something has changed over time.&#xA0; Jongmin tells me the envelope of the signal in Figure 7 is due to the friction load.</p><p>Figure 7: Raw vibration data early in the life of the motor</p><p>As the teeth of one of the gears (Figure 4)&#xA0;become worn, it causes some spikes and the time domain signal changes (Figure 8).</p><p>Figure 8: Mid-life raw vibration data</p><p>Finally the teeth are almost worn out, and the signal in Figure 9 is much less structured than the earlier plots.</p><p>Figure 9: Raw vibration data near end of life</p><p>The take-away from all of this is that you can often predict machine failure BEFORE it occurs, simply by looking&#xA0;at the vibration signature of the machine.&#xA0; By the way, the sensor used to take these measurements is the <a href=\"https://www.nxp.com/products/sensors/motion-sensors/6-axis-sensors/digital-sensor-3d-accelerometer-2g-4g-8g-plus-3d-magnetometer:FXOS8700CQ\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">FXOS8700CQ</a><sup>2</sup>, which is a small (3 mm x 3 mm) consumer grade 6-axis device containing both accelerometer and magnetometer.&#xA0; It was configured to sample at 400 Hz for these examples.</p><p>My next posting will continue the &#x201C;Mining Sensor Data&#x201D; series, with a look at an everyday chaotic system you&#x2019;ll find in your own kitchen.</p><p>&#xA0;</p>",

The starting point for this is often raw vibration data from an accelerometer.&#xA0; The machine condition monitoring industry has been utilizing vibration data for many years to predict machine failure before it occurs.&#xA0; If you&#x2019;re looking online, you&#x2019;ll find the industry has a number of aliases:</p><p>All refer to essentially the same thing.&#xA0; For cost reasons,&#xA0;machine monitoring&#xA0;was historically used only for very expensive machines that cannot tolerate unscheduled downtime.&#xA0; MEMS technology has now reduced the sensor cost to negligible levels, and the only thing standing in the way of further adoption is expertise and software availability.&#xA0; And things are changing there too.</p><p>Figure 1: Centrifugal Pump (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Centrifugal_Pump-mod.jpg)</p><p>Let&#x2019;s look at some examples.&#xA0; The figure above shows a &#x201C;classic&#x201D; industrial application.&#xA0; A rotary motor is coupled mechanically to a centrifugal pump.&#xA0; The motor, coupling and pump are all subject to various physical problems.&#xA0; These include things like:</p><p>Interestingly, ALL of these problems manifest themselves as changes in the vibration signature(s) of the system.</p><p>Figure 2: Shaft Misalignment</p><p>Figure 2 shows variations in shaft alignment between the motor and pump.&#xA0;&#xA0;These can cause&#xA0;a 2X rotation frequency term to show up in Fast Fourier Transform results&#xA0;run on vibration sensor outputs.</p><p>Figure 3: Effects of Bearing Defects</p><p>Figure 3 is a simplified view of a bearing, with inner trace, outer trace and roller balls between the two.&#xA0;&#xA0;Defects in any of these three will again manifest themselves in the vibration data FFT.&#xA0; The changes in frequency content are well&#xA0;understood as a function of the bearing geometry, and are shown n the figure.&#xA0; The variables in these equations include:</p><p>In coming posts, I&#x2019;m going to explore other patterns.&#xA0;&#xA0;Some are deterministic (like those shown above).&#xA0; Others are purely statistical.&#xA0; My colleagues and&#xA0;I&#xA0;will also&#xA0;give you a peak at the tools and workflow we&#x2019;re using to collect and analyze data.&#xA0;&#xA0;This includes&#xA0;advanced machine learning techniques, which is an area of science that didn&#x2019;t even exist when I went to school.&#xA0; We&#x2019;re having a lot of fun using it to look for patterns.&#xA0; You can too.</p><p>In the meantime, if you are intrigued by the examples shown above, pick up a copy of the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Harris-Vibration-Handbook-McGraw-Hill-Handbooks/dp/0071508198\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Harris&#x2019; Shock and Vibration Handbook (Sixth Edition)<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>.&#xA0; Chapter 16 gives a great overview of &#x201C;Condition Monitoring of Machinery&#x201D;.</p><p>&#xA0;</p>",

While most people access the web at home or at work, even in today&#x2019;s digital world libraries have unique advantages over the ever-growing tide of internet data.</p><p>Looking to the libraries of the future, the Aspen Institute&#x2019;s excellent report &#x2018;<a href=\"http://csreports.aspeninstitute.org/documents/AspenLibrariesReport.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Rising to the Challenge<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>&#x2019; outlines some of them. Libraries are trusted by their local community. They help tackle social inequalities, and are often the only free access millions of people have to the internet. They give young people a creative learning environment after school. They help people find jobs, access government and local services and health resources, and carry on with their lifelong learning. They offer different media to help people learn the way that suits them best: text, data, audio or video.</p><p>Most of all, libraries offer space &#x2013; physical space. I am myself a member of several internet forums which at best offer their members one or two live events a year for presentations and exhibitions. Public Libraries on the other hand offer their members live events every day. The shelves form a constant exhibition, and a theatre in the same building can serve for novelist readings and other presentations.</p><p>Librarians are another unique resource, but too often they spend their time checking books in and out, and making sure that the books on the shelves match the library&#x2019;s inventory. Librarians&#x2019; time is valuable, and we need to make best use of it.</p><p>People often need help navigating the library access systems and &#x2013; when you&#x2019;re studying &#x2013; you often need expert knowledge to even know what questions to ask. You want to spend your time on study or enjoyment rather than queuing or searching through huge amounts of data for what you need.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/book.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-4027 alignright\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/book-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"open book\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/book-300x300.jpg 300w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/book-150x150.jpg 150w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/book-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/book-320x320.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"></a></p><p>New technology is helping with this, and we&#x2019;ll for example be seeing more Radio-Frequency Identification tags appearing in library books and other media. RFID can save time from the moment you enter the library by automating the book and media return handling. It can exist alongside barcodes, but reads much faster &#x2013; up to 60 different tags/second.</p><p>RFID doesn&#x2019;t need line of sight, and has high&#xA0; immunity to dirt and other obscuring layers. You can read the tags over a greater distance than barcodes, and data on the tag can be changed or updated. RFID tags are less vulnerable to damage because they are not printed on paper, and don&#x2019;t need to be fixed to the outside of an item. There&#x2019;s none of the multiple swipes that you often come across with barcodes.</p><p>Combined with automated materials handling systems, RFID can also help to get media back onto the shelves faster and more accurately.&#xA0; Some libraries hold millions of books, CDs, DVDs and videos and it is a phenomenal challenge for librarians to keep track of them all. Automated systems can accept returns, update your account, and sort the items to go back on the shelves. Some libraries are reporting a factor four shorter time back to shelf &#x2013; which is where you need them to be. Hand-held readers can scan shelves for misplaced books, and some libraries have found thousands of dollars worth of &#x201C;lost&#x201D; items with RFID shelf management programs.</p><p>Now a stable technology with open architectures, RFID is seeing exciting new developments. The latest is Near Field Communication. NFC-enabled devices can for example download book titles straight to your phone, and link to web pages with more information (more below).</p><p>RFID readers have an IC that produces an alternating current and an antenna that converts it into a magnetic field. That is picked up by the tag&#x2019;s antenna, which resonates to give enough power to bounce back an encoded identifier number (which can be the same as the existing barcode ID number) so the tags don&#x2019;t need a battery.</p><p>NXP&#x2019;s SLIX RFID chip family is already in use at over 5000 public and university libraries around the world, and we&#x2019;ve recently introduced a backwards compatible successor, SLIX 2. This makes for 50% faster inventory scanning, one of the most time consuming library jobs. Instead of aiming and scanning book by book with barcode inventory scanning &#x2013; with SLIX 2 you just swipe over the shelf.</p><p>The new ICs make book searches and inventory scanning even faster and more accurate. Shelf contents are immediately updated, so shelf accuracy is significantly improved. The ICs have extra memory for URLs with additional media information.</p><p>That has benefits, too, particularly when combined with Near Field Communication.</p><p>Most of today&#x2019;s smartphones offer NFC, and SLIX 2 now lets you use it to watch movie trailers and check author bios, book reviews.</p><p>With NFC, the physical book on the shelf guides you to the related content on the internet. No need to type in the web address. Just tap your phone on the book&#x2019;s SLIX 2 label and the phone&#x2019;s library app will automatically open the associated web page. It works with zero clicks, and without having to use the phone&#x2019;s camera to scan a barcode. Just tap a movie DVD to watch the trailer. Or tap a book to be guided to a blog space of reviews. The tag&#x2019;s memory is segmented, with separate access conditions and password protection where needed.</p><p>Being supported by the widely available NFC infrastructure helps SLIX 2 to displace barcodes in many other applications for identifying objects and automatically updating inventory. SLIX 2 can be used for managing medical records, for example, tracking documents, ticketing and authorized service monitoring.</p><p>Don&#x2019;t underestimate the physical benefits of libraries. Seeing a picture of a book on the web doesn&#x2019;t compare with physically holding that book in your hand &#x2013; much like watching movies about all the nice places in the world doesn&#x2019;t compare to actually going on holiday.</p><p>To keep our Public Libraries, we need to use them. Next time you are going past your local library, walk in.</p>",

In his own words he hopes that this will help ensure Britain &#x201C;stays ahead in the race to driverless technology&#x201D;.</p><p>Firstly, I would like to give my congratulations to the UK for this bold step. I expect this will give a boost to autonomous driving not just in the UK but also will have far reaching consequences across Europe.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/NXP_041114_-448.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3947\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/NXP_041114_-448-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"NXP_041114_-448\" width=\"610\" height=\"407\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/NXP_041114_-448-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/NXP_041114_-448-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\"></a></p><p>What matters even more than the financial investment, is that this move helps to overcome challenges of technology adoption for autonomous driving. I.e., it:</p><p>Once the public gets to experience the benefits of autonomous driving, the solutions to these problems will accelerate rapidly. The UK is the first country that has envisioned a simple set of rules; other countries are far more restrictive and need to catch up.</p><p>Once these issues are overcome autonomous driving can really take off as the basic technology already exists. The core components are Vehicle-to-X communications technology, radar and cameras all complemented by secure communications to prevent hacking.</p><p>Vehicle-to-X technology is &#x2013; from a technological point of view &#x2013; ready to roll. We have already started mass production with our NXP RoadLINK chip and Delphi was the first to announce that its V2X communications platform was to be built into selected GM cars from 2017 onwards.</p><p>Radar has been around for a while. Today, radar sensors already exist for a variety of applications such as lane change assist, blind spot detection or adaptive cruise control. Modern high-end vehicles typically feature a multi-chip single SiGe radar system &#x2013;&#xA0; they are operational but are still bulky, consume significant power and also the performance will need to step up to go from today&#x2019;s radar-based assistance systems to fully autonomous driving.</p><p>At NXP we are working on this. A prototype of our 80GHz radar chip is currently in the hands of OEMs and Tier 1s for evaluation. Expectations are high among automakers for building cars with lots of high-resolution short range automotive radar for various applications including vulnerable road user detection &#x2014; cyclists and pedestrians for example.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/car.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-4009\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/car.jpg\" alt=\"car\" width=\"523\" height=\"516\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/car.jpg 608w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/car-300x297.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 523px) 100vw, 523px\"></a></p><p>Another aspect is security. As with any other wireless connection or network, communications are exposed to security risks that must be guarded against in order to prevent access from hackers and other potential threats. To do this, the quality and integrity of data has to be ensured and privacy needs to be protected &#x2013; again the technology solutions already exist to mitigate these risks.</p><p>As engineers we have been playing our role in putting the technology in place for driverless cars so it&#x2019;s great to see governments also helping to bring this technology closer to citizens and establish trust in this new means of transportation.</p>",

As the global population strives to achieve constant connectivity, the trend that began with cellular phones and was quickly replicated across consumer electronics with e-readers and tablets is now being seen as a requirement in many other segments of the market, from industrial to medical.</p><p>This demand results in the requirement for ever smaller printed circuit boards (PCBs) and one of the most effective ways to achieve this is to stack two packages on top of each other, known as package on package (PoP.) The two main benefits of PoP are board space savings and minimizing track length between different interoperating parts, such as a CPU and memory. This yields better electrical performance of devices, since shorter routing of interconnections between circuits yields faster signal propagation and reduced noise and cross-talk. Based on these advantages more and more companies are looking to design utilizing PoP most commonly placing the CPU on the PCB and stacking the memory package on top.</p><p>The i.MX 6Dual/6Quad processors feature Freescale&#x2019;s advanced implementation of the quad ARM&#xAE; Cortex&#xAE;-A9 core, which operates at speeds up to 1 .2 GHz. They include 2D and 3D graphics processors, 3D 1080p video processing, and integrated power management. Since the launch of the i.MX 6 series, customers have based designs ranging from automotive infotainment systems to industrial, consumer and medical devices on these processors. Both parts are currently available in a 21mm x21 mm 0.8 mm pitch FCPBGA package, however we have increasingly been asked by customers to enable smaller designs with these processors. Based on this customer demand, we will be making i.MX 6Dual/6Quad processors available in a smaller 12 mm x 12 mm, 0.4 mm pitch, FCPBGA, PoP; with the upper package being a 4Gb mobile LP-DDR2 memory package from Micron. Both the top and bottom of the package meet JEDEC standard design guideline ensuring easy of design and layout for customers. The i.MX6 PoP will also be part of Freescale&#x2019;s longevity program so enabling customers to utilize PoP for projects with long life cycles.</p><p>PoP, similar to any technology, has advantages but can also present design challenges. Two challenges that may occur with any PoP are soldering, between the packages and thermal dissipation. Both of these challenges can be overcome if the two packages are designed and tested in a stacked PoP implementation. We know that reliable PoP development requires close collaboration with the memory vendor. This is why we choose to partner with Micron for our i.MX PoP offering. Together, we can carefully engineer the packages and review the thermal profiles to ensure maximum compatibility. Micron has published a POP User Guide (CSN 34) that provides a wealth of technical information. See:&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.micron.com/~/media/Documents/Products/Customer%20Service%20Note/csn34_pop_user_guide.pdf\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">http://www.micron.com/~/media/Documents/Products/Customer%20Service%20Note/csn34_pop_user_guide.pdf<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a></p><p>Micron is a major player with LPDRAM and PoP packages in the mobile/wireless space, and now a market leader in supporting LPDDR to the non-wireless market space.&#xA0;&#xA0; They worked closely with us in developing an automotive temp grade 216b 8Gb (dual-die package) x64 LPDDR2 PoP package for use on the i.MX6 Dual and Quad applications processors.&#xA0; This PoP device provides simpler routing to a system and allows for board space savings to customers.&#xA0; The LPDDR2 has been tested to be guaranteed to function up to max temp of 105C temp (Normally max temp 85C.) The memory package also includes on-die temperature sensors that can be used by software to throttle the application processor down if the temperate gets too hot and increase the refresh rate of the DRAM.</p><p>Working with Micron has enabled us to offer customers a reliable, longterm PoP solution. However, we realize that many customers looking to capitalize of the advantages of PoP have little experience with the technology. To provide not only an evaluation board, but also design services and expertise in PoP designs, we have worked with two partners that have extensive experience with PoP designs across many industries, TechNexion and Mistral Solutions.</p><p>Mistral Solutions has recently launched the VISE board, that runs on the 800 MHz quad/dual core i.MX6 PoP .&#xA0; The VISE board is based on a dual board architecture, consisting of a core module and a carrier module comprising of display, audio, gigabit Ethernet and other peripheral Interfaces.

We talked about how it would enable highly functional, extremely secure and power efficient IoT devices that require constant connectivity and higher levels of integration with their surrounding environment. Well, it&#x2019;s here! IoT, meet i.MX 6SoloX. The i.MX 6SoloX is the industry&#x2019;s first applications processor to integrate an ARM&#xAE; Cortex&#xAE;-A9 core and an ARM Cortex-M4 core in a single-chip design to enable devices with world-class security, exception performance and power efficiency. And, since it is part of the popular i.MX 6 series, it leverages years of software development and industry-wide enablement.</p><p>How is the i.MX 6SoloX processor is bringing new levels of system security to IoT devices? Well&#x2026;</p><p>(1)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; The ability to run multiple independent software environments within a single System-on-Chip (SoC). This provides the capability to deploy a user interface-rich operating system on the Cortex-A9 core and benefit from the real-time determinism that is provided by the Cortex-M4 core. This is important for a wide range of automotive, building automation and medical devices that require a more evolved user experience but must have a reliable, secure and deterministic way of communicating with other devices in a network.</p><p>(2)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; The uniquely designed Resource Domain Controller (RDC) enforces the safe sharing or exclusive access of SoC resources (peripherals, shared memory) by the Cortex-A9 core and Cortex-M4 core to ensure that the operating environments can coexist independently in a secure manner, i.e. the Cortex-A9 domain will not try to take control of a peripheral that is, and must remain, dedicated to the Cortex-M4 domain. The RDC has a full programming model and the entire register map is available to either, or both, cores. This additional measure of flexibility ensures that the user can partition their system uniquely to their requirements.</p><p>(3)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Authenticated, secure boot (high-assurance boot) can be used to verify that the software boot image is authorized to run on the device. And, with the Cortex-M4 core involved, very fast secure boot times can be realized. High-assurance boot is a critical security feature that assists in preventing tampered boot images from being run on the device. In addition, cryptographic cipher engines and secure on-chip data storage round out the advanced security offerings of the i.MX 6SoloX applications processor.</p><p>In addition to the world-class security that i.MX 6SoloX will bring to new IoT devices, the independent power domains within the SoC allow it to provide smart system power &#x2014; new ways of managing system-level tasks in the most power efficient way. The Cortex-M4 core can be used for low-level system monitoring tasks such as maintaining a wired or wireless connection or gathering inputs from sensors, all while the Cortex-A9 core and other higher-performing peripherals like the 2D and 3D GPU are power-gated. This provides maximum power efficiency during less process intensive, but highly critical, tasks as well as the ability to quickly and significantly scale up the performance and display capabilities of the system.</p><p>Other key features of the i.MX 6SoloX multicore applications processor include:</p><p>Excited to get started designing with the i.MX 6SoloX applications processor?

As a semiconductor industry veteran, I&#x2019;m always driving for new ways to enable innovation in the market. I&#x2019;m pretty passionate about both of these items and love it when I get to combine them! I&#x2019;ve blogged several times in the past about the wearables market including <a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/iot/2014/01/party-like-its-1991-the-austin-marathon-returns-to-freescale/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">my own marathon journey<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> and how my job fits into that journey.</p><p>Let me take a step back though and talk about wearables. According to Google&#xAE;, the electronic definition of wearable is: &#x201C;denoting or relating to a computer or other electronic device that is small or light enough to be worn or carried on one&#x2019;s body&#x201D;. This definition highlights a couple of the challenges in creating wearable devices: size and functionality. However, there&#x2019;s more to it than that.&#xA0; The use cases for wearable technology are diverse and cover multiple market segments and applications. Examples include fitness watches, smart watches, glasses, cameras, healthcare patches, wrist bands, virtual reality gears, smart clothing or smart shoes and the possibilities are endless as technology evolves. Each of these use cases has its own criteria and challenges to solve.</p><p>We have&#xA0;provided solutions that address the key requirements for this market for many years and continues to evolve our solutions as the market evolves: size, battery life, user experience and connectivity. Our microcontrollers, microprocessors, connectivity and sensor portfolios provide scalable, low power and targeted features to address the various use cases. We also provide enablement such as application specific reference designs like the <a href=\"http://www.warpboard.org\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">WaRP board<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> around our technology to give developers a head start in their development efforts.</p><p>That&#x2019;s gives you a brief summary of wearables and our&#xA0;involvement in this market so now let&#x2019;s turn to the second aspect of this blog: running. I live and work&#xA0;in Austin, TX where running is a key part of the core culture. You&#x2019;ll see runners all over town at all times of the day and night. The <a href=\"http://youraustinmarathon.com/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Austin Marathon and Half Marathon<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> was started by Motorola many years ago and we&#xA0;re-started sponsorship of this iconic Austin event last year. In gearing up for this year&#x2019;s Austin Marathon, we wanted to address the topics of wearables and running by testing how wearable technology impacts athletes. And as a runner myself, this topic was of great interest so I eagerly got involved in the experiment.</p><p><strong>The Experiment</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Garmin_220.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-11797 alignright\" src=\"http://blogs.freescale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Garmin_220.jpg\" alt=\"Garmin_220\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\"></a>The objective of the project was to track how wearable technology assists with motivation and performance, as well as to uncover overall attitudes towards wearable technology when training for a race.</p><p>We partnered with a local running store, <a href=\"http://www.roguerunning.com/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Rogue Running<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a>, who trains hundreds of athletes for all types of running events to run this experiment.&#xA0; This also happens to be the place that I train and the specific running group I train with was selected to be the experiment group (lucky me!). We worked with the group&#x2019;s coach (Chris McClung) to identify 25 people training for the Austin Marathon or Half Marathon and provided them with <a href=\"https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/into-sports/running/forerunner-220/prod129397.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">Garmin 220<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> running watches (enabled by Kinetis <a href=\"http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/taxonomy.jsp?code=K20_USB_MCU&amp;cof=0&amp;am=0\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\" class=\"wpel-icon-right\">K22 MCU<span class=\"wpel-icon wpel-image wpel-icon-7\"></span></a> based on ARM technology). Garmin Connect (an online tool and app for capturing data from the watch) was used by everyone to upload their running data and share with others in the group. The requirements were to submit a weekly report from Garmin Connect on their running and submit three surveys through the 12-week trial period (beginning, middle and end) answering a series of qualitative and quantitative questions directly related to their training experience. The group was a great mix of seasoned and beginner runners, men and women as well as a range of ages. I&#x2019;ve enjoyed training with this great group of people for a while now, but this experiment definitely helped us become an even tighter group.</p><p><strong>The Results</strong></p><p>The overall results from the group resonated very strongly with my experience with a majority of the group (95%) reporting the wearable having a positive effect on their training regimen. Here are the highlights:</p><p>Back to my personal story, I ran the Austin Marathon last year to push myself and run a marathon on a difficult course in my own hometown. It went well, but I didn&#x2019;t achieve my initial goal with weather (hot and humid) being the main reason why I had to re-adjust my goal. This year, I wanted to try a different course and push myself to a more aggressive goal so I chose to run the Houston Marathon on Jan 18<sup>th</sup>.</p><p>Once the decision was made, I dedicated myself to the training program Coach Chris prescribed! The experiment and Garmin watch helped keep me motivated and honest.&#xA0; I travel frequently for work, am a mom to two kids (14 years and 12 years old) and a wife so it&#x2019;s difficult to find time for everything. However, knowing that all my data was being tracked and available to my coach helped give me that extra bit of motivation to always get my runs in and to do them right.</p><p>In the end, all this hard work paid off big time for me as I achieved a personal record of 4 hours 18 min in the Houston Marathon which was 12 min faster than my first marathon and 14 min faster than my performance in last year&#x2019;s Austin Marathon! The feeling of accomplishment and happiness was beyond my expectations. Coach Chris kept telling me to &#x201C;trust the training&#x201D;.&#xA0; Although I had some initial doubts, by race day I knew in my heart that I was capable of executing the plan because I trusted Coach Chris&#x2019; assessment of my running abilities and knew I had done the work. The data he had access to during this training definitely gave me more confidence in his goal for me.</p><p>With the Houston Marathon over, the Austin Half Marathon was next. I was very tempted to &#x201C;race&#x201D; this course but instead used my Garmin watch to keep myself in check and run it for fun not for a personal record. A month is not long enough to fully recover from a marathon so the goal truly was to enjoy the experience of a half marathon and not get injured. What&#x2019;s next? I&#x2019;m not sure on the details yet, but I do know that I&#x2019;ll continue to use my Garmin watch to push myself and smash more personal records.</p><p>&#xA0;</p>",

      "content": "<p>U.S. Congressman Mike Honda, representing California&#x2019;s 17th Congressional District, visited NXP&#x2019;s San Jose, CA office on Tuesday, February 17. To kick off the NXP facility tour, the Congressman first discussed challenging issues such as cybersecurity that he as a legislator and NXP as a key industry are both working on from differing approaches. In the course of this conversation with a number of NXP&#x2019;s executives, it was agreed that policymakers should actively engage with industry to draw upon insights and experiences gained through extensive research and development and prior work on security-related issues.</p><p>With NXP&#x2019;s CEO and Congressman Honda both having attended President Obama&#x2019;s cybersecurity summit held at Stanford the week prior, much of the discussion centered on security and consumer privacy. At the Stanford event, over 700 policy makers, executives, technologist, educators and others gathered to hear about the cybersecurity threat and related hurdles to economic expansion and consumer security. During the event Obama identified several priorities including: securing payments, and moving the U.S. EMV transition forward, two factor authentication and an initial mention of three factor authentication.</p><p>Following this discussion, Congressman Honda engaged a dialogue with a large group of NXP employees in the break room. Honda invited questions from the employees. Questions ranged from healthcare to consumer data protection, the need for more STEM-oriented thinking in Congress, and issues of security and technology. NXP enjoyed the opportunity to speak with Congressman Honda and educate him further on opportunities to enhance security and make citizens data safe.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;d like to thank Rep. Honda for his visit to our office to provide his constituents the opportunity to hear directly from him what his current focus is on and how what he does in Washington DC will affect the future of Silicon Valley and beyond,&#x201D; said Rick Clemmer, CEO and president, NXP Semiconductors.</p><p><a href=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SanJose.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3941\" src=\"http://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SanJose-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"SanJose\" width=\"610\" height=\"407\" srcset=\"https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SanJose-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://blog.nxp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SanJose-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\"></a></p><p>As Americans increasingly adopt connected devices in their everyday lives and the Internet of Things, wearable technology and connected cars continue to redefine our lives, the importance of securing these devices will also increase. NXP, with is strong market leadership in security, will continue to drive new and innovative solutions that support governments and consumers worldwide.</p>",
